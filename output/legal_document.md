4.2 Authorized Users. Access to the SaaS Platform is restricted to Authorized Users who have been issued unique login credentials by the Customer or the Provider. The Customer shall be responsible for ensuring that all Authorized Users comply with the terms of this Agreement and shall be liable for any acts or omissions of its Authorized Users that would constitute a breach of this Agreement if taken by the Customer. The Customer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized access to or use of the SaaS Platform and shall notify the Provider immediately of any such unauthorized access or use.

4.3 Documentation License. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the Provider grants to the Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to use and reproduce the Documentation during the Subscription Term solely for the Customer's internal business purposes in connection with its authorized use of the SaaS Platform.

The Customer shall not, and shall not permit any third party to: (a) modify, adapt, translate, or create derivative works based on the SaaS Platform or Documentation; (b) license, sublicense, sell, resell, rent, lease, transfer, assign, distribute, time share, or otherwise commercially exploit or make the SaaS Platform available to any third party other than Authorized Users; (c) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code, object code, or underlying structure, ideas, or algorithms of the SaaS Platform, except to the extent such restriction is prohibited by applicable law; (d) remove, alter, or obscure any proprietary notices, labels, or marks from the SaaS Platform or Documentation; (e) use the SaaS Platform in any manner that violates any applicable local, state, federal, or international law or regulation; (f) interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the SaaS Platform or the data contained therein; (g) attempt to gain unauthorized access to the SaaS Platform or its related systems or networks; or (h) access or use the SaaS Platform for the purpose of building a competitive product or service or for any other benchmarking or competitive analysis.

4.5 Reservation of Rights. The SaaS Platform is provided as a service, and no ownership of the underlying software is transferred to the Customer. The Provider and its licensors retain all right, title, and interest (including all intellectual property rights) in and to the SaaS Platform, the Documentation, and any updates, enhancements, or modifications thereto. No rights are granted to the Customer hereunder other than as expressly set forth in this Section 4.

4.6 Usage Limits and Monitoring. The Customer’s use of the SaaS Platform may be subject to usage limits, including, but not limited to, storage capacity, data throughput, or API call frequency as defined in the Order Form. The Provider shall have the right to monitor the Customer’s use of the SaaS Platform to ensure compliance with this Agreement. If the Customer exceeds its allocated usage limits, the Provider reserves the right to charge for such excess usage at its then-current rates or to require the Customer to upgrade to a higher-tier subscription.

4.7 Suspension of Access. The Provider may, in its reasonable discretion, suspend the Customer's or any Authorized User's access to the SaaS Platform if: (a) any Fee is thirty (30) days or more overdue; (b) the Provider reasonably believes that the Customer or an Authorized User is in breach of the restrictions set forth in Section 4.4; or (c) such suspension is necessary to prevent an immediate threat to the security, integrity, or availability of the SaaS Platform or the data of other customers. The Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Customer with notice of any such suspension and shall restore access as soon as the circumstances giving rise to the suspension have been resolved to the Provider’s satisfaction. No credits or refunds will be issued for any period of suspension resulting from the Customer's breach.

## 5. Authorized Users, Account Security, and Access Credentials

5. AUTHORIZED USERS, ACCOUNT SECURITY, AND ACCESS CREDENTIALS

5.1 Authorized User Designation. Access to and use of the Services is restricted to the specific individuals authorized by the Customer who have been assigned unique login credentials ("Authorized Users"). Customer shall ensure that the number of Authorized Users does not exceed the maximum number of seats or licenses permitted under the applicable Order Form. Customer represents and warrants that all Authorized Users are employees, contractors, or agents acting on behalf of the Customer in the ordinary course of business and are bound by confidentiality and non-use obligations no less restrictive than those set forth in this Agreement.

5.2 Security of Access Credentials. Each Authorized User must be assigned a unique set of access credentials, including but not limited to usernames, passwords, API keys, or security tokens ("Credentials"). Customer and its Authorized Users are strictly prohibited from sharing, transferring, or sub-licensing Credentials to any third party or among multiple individuals. Customer shall maintain, and shall ensure that all Authorized Users maintain, the absolute confidentiality and security of all Credentials. Customer shall implement industry-standard administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to prevent unauthorized access to or use of the Services.

5.3 Responsibility for Account Activity. Customer shall be solely and exclusively responsible for any and all activities, actions, and omissions that occur under its account or through the use of Credentials assigned to its Authorized Users, regardless of whether such activity was authorized by Customer. Any breach of this Agreement by an Authorized User shall be deemed a material breach by the Customer. The Provider shall not be liable for any loss or damage arising from Customer’s failure to comply with these security obligations.

5.4 Notification of Compromise. Customer shall notify the Provider immediately, in writing and via the Provider’s designated emergency support channel, upon discovering or having a reasonable suspicion of any unauthorized use of Credentials, any unauthorized access to the Customer’s account, or any other breach of security related to the Services. Upon such notification, the Provider reserves the right to suspend the affected Credentials or account until the security breach is remediated to the Provider's satisfaction.

5.5 Monitoring and Verification. The Provider reserves the right, but does not assume the obligation, to monitor account activity to ensure compliance with the terms of this Section. If the Provider identifies suspicious activity or patterns suggesting Credential sharing or unauthorized access, the Provider may, in its sole and absolute discretion, unilaterally reset passwords, suspend access, or terminate Authorized User accounts without prior notice. Customer shall provide reasonable assistance to the Provider in any investigation into unauthorized access.

5.6 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). To the extent the Services support Multi-Factor Authentication or similar enhanced security protocols, Customer agrees to mandate the use of such protocols for all Authorized Users. Customer acknowledges that the failure to utilize available security features increases the risk of unauthorized access, and Customer assumes all liability for security incidents resulting from the failure to enable or properly configure such features.

5.7 Termination of Access. Upon the termination of an Authorized User’s employment or engagement with the Customer, or upon a change in the Authorized User’s role that no longer requires access to the Services, Customer shall immediately revoke such individual’s access and deactivate their Credentials through the administrative console or by providing written notice to the Provider.

5.8 Equipment and Connectivity. Customer is solely responsible for obtaining and maintaining all computer hardware, software, network connectivity, and telecommunications services required to access the Services. The Provider shall have no liability for interruptions in service or security vulnerabilities arising from Customer’s local environment or third-party internet service providers.

## 8. Modifications to the SaaS Platform

8. MODIFICATIONS TO THE SAAS PLATFORM

8.1 Right to Modify. The Provider reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to modify, update, enhance, or otherwise alter the SaaS Platform, including its features, functionality, user interface, and technical specifications, at any time and without prior notice to the Subscriber, except as expressly provided herein. Such modifications may include, without limitation, the addition of new features, the removal or deprecation of existing features, or the implementation of security patches, bug fixes, and performance improvements.

8.2 Core Functionality and Material Changes. While the Provider endeavors to improve the SaaS Platform, it shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that any modification does not materially diminish the core functionality of the Services as described in the then-current Documentation. In the event that a proposed modification results in a material and adverse degradation of the core functionality, the Provider shall provide the Subscriber with no less than thirty (30) days' prior written notice via the SaaS Platform interface or the email address associated with the Subscriber’s account.

8.3 Forced Updates and Maintenance. The Subscriber acknowledges and agrees that the SaaS Platform is a multi-tenant, cloud-based software-as-a-service environment. Consequently, the Provider may deploy mandatory updates, "hotfixes," or emergency security protocols across its entire infrastructure. The Subscriber shall have no right to decline or delay the implementation of such updates. The Provider shall not be liable for any temporary downtime, service interruptions, or performance latency resulting from the deployment of such modifications, provided they are conducted in accordance with the Provider’s standard maintenance window policies.

8.4 Deprecation of Features. The Provider may, as part of its product lifecycle management, elect to discontinue or "sunset" specific features, modules, or legacy integrations. In such instances, the Provider will provide the Subscriber with reasonable advance notice of the deprecation schedule. The Subscriber’s continued use of the SaaS Platform following the effective date of feature deprecation shall constitute acceptance of the modified service offering.

8.5 Compatibility and Interoperability. The Subscriber is solely responsible for ensuring that its internal hardware, software systems, network configurations, and third-party integrations remain compatible with the most current version of the SaaS Platform. The Provider shall not be held liable for any loss of interoperability or data transmission errors arising from the Subscriber's failure to update its own systems or APIs in response to modifications made to the SaaS Platform.

8.6 Proprietary Rights in Modifications. All intellectual property rights, including but not limited to patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and trademarks, in and to any modifications, enhancements, or derivative works of the SaaS Platform, whether based on the Provider's internal development roadmap or resulting from feedback, suggestions, or requests provided by the Subscriber, shall vest exclusively in the Provider. The Subscriber hereby assigns to the Provider all right, title, and interest in and to any such feedback or suggested modifications.

8.7 Beta Features. From time to time, the Provider may offer access to "Beta," "Early Access," or "Experimental" features. Such features are provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" without any warranty of any kind. The Provider may modify or terminate access to Beta features at any time without notice or liability. Participation in Beta testing is at the Subscriber’s sole risk, and the Provider makes no guarantee that Beta features will ever be incorporated into the general release of the SaaS Platform.

## 9. Service Availability, Uptime Guarantees, and SLAs

9. SERVICE AVAILABILITY, UPTIME GUARANTEES, AND SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS (SLA)

9.1 Service Commitment. The Company shall employ commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the hosted Services and underlying infrastructure remain operational and accessible to the Customer with a Monthly Uptime Percentage of at least ninety-nine and nine-tenths percent (99.9%) during any calendar month (the "Service Commitment").

9.2 Definitions. For the purposes of this Agreement, the following definitions shall apply:

(b) "Monthly Uptime Percentage" is calculated by subtracting from 100% the percentage of minutes during the calendar month in which the Service was in a state of Unavailability, excluding any time resulting from SLA Exclusions defined in Section 9.4.
(c) "Service Credit" means a dollar credit, calculated as a percentage of the monthly fees paid by the Customer for the affected month, which the Company may apply to future invoices.

9.3 Maintenance Windows.
(a) Scheduled Maintenance: The Company reserves the right to perform periodic maintenance, including but not limited to system updates, hardware replacement, and database optimization. The Company shall provide the Customer with at least forty-eight (48) hours of prior notice via email or a notification within the Service interface. Scheduled Maintenance shall not constitute Unavailability for the purposes of Service Credit calculations.
(b) Emergency Maintenance: In circumstances where the Company identifies a critical security vulnerability, imminent hardware failure, or other catastrophic risk to the Service’s integrity, the Company may perform Emergency Maintenance without prior notice. The Company shall use diligent efforts to minimize the duration of such maintenance and provide retrospective notification to the Customer.

9.4 SLA Exclusions. The Service Commitment does not apply to any performance or availability issues, and no Service Credits shall be issued for Unavailability caused by:
(i) Factors outside the Company’s reasonable control, including Force Majeure events, acts of government, strikes, riots, or large-scale internet routing disruptions beyond the Company’s direct network;
(ii) Failures or malfunctions of the Customer’s internal hardware, local area networks, software configurations, or third-party internet service providers;
(iii) Unauthorized actions or omissions by the Customer, its employees, agents, or contractors, including but not limited to the misuse of API keys or violation of the Acceptable Use Policy;
(iv) Suspensions or terminations of the Service by the Company resulting from the Customer’s breach of the Agreement or non-payment of fees;
(v) Beta, trial, "early access," or "no-charge" features or services which are expressly excluded from any uptime guarantees;
(vi) The Customer’s failure to adhere to any required system configurations or use of unsupported platforms.

9.5 Service Credit Process and Remedies.
(a) In the event the Company fails to meet the Service Commitment, the Customer may be eligible for Service Credits according to the following schedule: 
(1) Monthly Uptime Percentage between 99.0% and 99.9%: 10% Service Credit;
(2) Monthly Uptime Percentage between 95.0% and 99.0%: 25% Service Credit;
(3) Monthly Uptime Percentage below 95.0%: 50% Service Credit.
(b) To receive a Service Credit, the Customer must submit a formal written claim to the Company’s billing department within thirty (30) calendar days of the end of the month in which the Service Commitment was not met. The claim must include dates, times, and logs documenting the purported Unavailability.
(c) If the Monthly Uptime Percentage is confirmed by the Company to be below the Service Commitment, the Company will issue the Service Credit to the Customer’s account within one billing cycle following the confirmation. Service Credits are non-refundable, non-transferable, and may not be exchanged for cash or other forms of legal tender.

9.6 Sole and Exclusive Remedy. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, the issuance of Service Credits as set forth in Section 9.5 shall be the Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy, and the Company’s entire liability, for any Unavailability, failure to meet the Service Commitment, or any other performance failure of the Services. The Company shall not be liable for any consequential, indirect, or incidental damages arising from Service Unavailability.

## 10. Scheduled Maintenance and Emergency Downtime

10. SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE AND EMERGENCY DOWNTIME

10.1. Service Availability and Maintenance Scope. The Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the availability of the Services provided hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Client acknowledges and agrees that the Provider may, from time to time, be required to suspend access to the Services or any portion thereof to perform necessary maintenance, repairs, or upgrades to the Provider’s underlying infrastructure, software, and hardware systems.

10.2. Scheduled Maintenance. "Scheduled Maintenance" refers to any maintenance for which the Provider provides advance notice to the Client. The Provider reserves the right to establish recurring maintenance windows during which time the Services may be temporarily unavailable. The Provider shall endeavor to provide at least forty-eight (48) hours’ prior electronic notice for any Scheduled Maintenance that is anticipated to result in a material service interruption. The Provider will use commercially reasonable efforts to schedule such maintenance during periods of historically low usage (off-peak hours) to minimize disruption to the Client’s operations. Any downtime occurring during a Scheduled Maintenance window shall be deemed "Excused Downtime" and shall not be counted toward any uptime guarantees or performance benchmarks.

10.3. Emergency Maintenance and Unscheduled Downtime. "Emergency Maintenance" refers to any unscheduled maintenance required to address critical issues including, but not limited to, security vulnerabilities, hardware failures, catastrophic network instability, or other urgent technical requirements that pose an immediate risk to the integrity, security, or performance of the Services, the Client Data, or the Provider’s infrastructure. The Provider reserves the right to perform Emergency Maintenance at any time and without prior notice to the Client. While the Provider shall attempt to notify the Client via designated communication channels as soon as reasonably practicable regarding the nature and expected duration of any Emergency Maintenance, the failure to provide such notice shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement nor entitle the Client to any remedies or credits.

10.4. Exclusions from Service Level Agreements. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in any Service Level Agreement (“SLA”) or other performance-related document, the Provider shall not be held liable for, and the Client shall not be entitled to any service credits or compensation for, any period of downtime, service interruption, or degraded performance resulting from: (a) Scheduled Maintenance; (b) Emergency Maintenance; (c) Force Majeure events as defined herein; (d) failures, outages, or maintenance of third-party infrastructure, including but not limited to cloud service providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) or internet service providers; (e) acts or omissions of the Client, its employees, or its third-party contractors; or (f) issues arising from the Client’s hardware, local network, or unauthorized modifications to the Services.

10.5. Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances shall the Provider be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages—including, without limitation, loss of profits, loss of data, business interruption, or loss of goodwill—arising out of or related to any service interruption, maintenance activity, or downtime authorized under this Section 10. The Client’s sole and exclusive remedy for any unavailability of the Services is limited to the issuance of Service Credits as specifically provided for in the applicable SLA, the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference.

10.6. Client Responsibility. The Client is responsible for maintaining its own backup systems and business continuity plans to mitigate the impact of any service interruptions. The Client shall cooperate with the Provider during maintenance periods and shall comply with any reasonable requests for technical information or assistance required to resolve service issues or complete maintenance activities. The Provider shall not be responsible for any delays in restoring the Services caused by the Client’s failure to provide such cooperation.

## 11. Technical Support Services and Response Times

11. TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES AND RESPONSE TIMES

11.1 Provision of Technical Support. Subject to the Customer’s continuous compliance with the terms of this Agreement and the timely payment of all applicable Subscription Fees, the Provider shall provide remote technical support services (“Technical Support”) to the Customer. Technical Support shall be limited to the identification and remediation of Errors, where “Error” is defined as a reproducible failure of the Services to substantially conform to the specifications set forth in the Documentation. Technical Support shall be available during the Provider’s Standard Business Hours, defined as 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM [Insert Time Zone], Monday through Friday, excluding any public holidays observed in the Provider’s jurisdiction.

11.2 Support Request Submission and Categorization. All requests for Technical Support must be submitted by the Customer’s designated technical contacts through the Provider’s authorized support portal or via electronic mail to the designated support address. Upon receipt of a support request, the Provider shall, in its sole but reasonable discretion, classify the request according to the following severity levels:
(a) Severity 1 (Critical): A total system outage or a critical failure of the Services that prevents the Customer from performing essential business functions in a production environment, with no reasonable workaround available.
(b) Severity 2 (High): A significant degradation of the Services' functionality or performance that materially impacts the Customer’s business operations, although the Services remain partially functional or a temporary workaround is available.
(c) Severity 3 (Normal): A minor functional issue, bug, or discrepancy that does not materially affect the Customer’s use of the Services, or general inquiries regarding the operation and configuration of the Services.
(d) Severity 4 (Low): Requests for information, cosmetic issues, documentation errors, or suggestions for future product enhancements.

11.3 Response Time Objectives. The Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to acknowledge receipt of a support request and initiate diagnostic activities within the following target Response Time frames:
(a) Severity 1: Two (2) Business Hours.
(b) Severity 2: Four (4) Business Hours.
(c) Severity 3: One (1) Business Day.
(d) Severity 4: Three (3) Business Days.
A “Response” is defined as an initial communication by a qualified support technician acknowledging the reported issue and providing a preliminary assessment or a request for additional clarifying information. Response Time objectives are targets only and do not constitute a performance guarantee.

11.4 Customer Cooperation and Obligations. The Provider’s obligation to provide Technical Support is expressly conditioned upon the Customer’s full cooperation. The Customer shall: (i) provide the Provider with all necessary information, including detailed descriptions of the Error, system logs, screenshots, and steps required to reproduce the Error; (ii) ensure that the primary contact possesses the requisite technical knowledge to assist the Provider; and (iii) implement any reasonable workarounds or patches recommended by the Provider. Any failure or delay by the Customer in providing such assistance shall relieve the Provider of its Response Time obligations hereunder for the duration of the delay.

11.5 Exclusions from Technical Support. The Provider shall have no obligation to provide Technical Support for issues arising out of or related to: (i) any unauthorized modification, alteration, or configuration of the Services by the Customer or any third party; (ii) the use of the Services in combination with any hardware, software, or data not provided or expressly approved in writing by the Provider; (iii) the Customer’s failure to maintain a compatible operating environment as specified in the Documentation; (iv) failures in the Customer’s internet connectivity, local area network, or internal infrastructure; (v) Errors caused by the Customer’s negligence, abuse, or use of the Services in violation of this Agreement; or (vi) the Customer’s refusal to implement updates, upgrades, or patches provided by the Provider. Any support services requested for excluded issues may be provided at the Provider’s then-current hourly consulting rates, subject to a separate written agreement.

11.6 Escalation Procedures. In the event that a Severity 1 or Severity 2 issue is not acknowledged or addressed within the specified Response Time objectives, the Customer may initiate an escalation process by contacting the Provider’s designated Support Manager. The parties shall then work in good faith to allocate sufficient resources to expedite the resolution of the reported issue.

11.7 Modification of Support Terms. The Provider reserves the right to modify the Technical Support policies and response time objectives from time to time, provided that such modifications do not result in a material diminution of the level of support provided to the Customer during the current Subscription Term. Notification of any such changes shall be provided to the Customer via electronic mail or through the support portal.

## 12. Professional Services and Statements of Work (SOW)

12. PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AND STATEMENTS OF WORK (SOW)

12.1 Engagement Framework. The Provider shall provide to the Customer those professional, technical, consulting, implementation, or training services (collectively, “Professional Services”) that are expressly set forth in a written Statement of Work (“SOW”) or Service Order executed by authorized representatives of both parties. Each SOW constitutes a separate, legally binding agreement that incorporates by reference the terms and conditions of this Master Agreement. In the event of an irreconcilable conflict between the general provisions of this Master Agreement and the specific terms of an SOW, the terms of this Master Agreement shall prevail, unless the SOW specifically identifies the section of this Agreement to be modified and contains an express declaration of the parties' intent to supersede that specific provision for the purposes of such SOW.

12.2 Change Management Protocol. Any modifications to the scope, deliverables, project timeline, or resource allocation defined in an SOW must be memorialized in a written "Change Order" executed by authorized representatives of both parties. Provider shall be under no obligation to initiate work on any requested modifications until a Change Order has been fully executed. Customer acknowledges that any requested changes may impact the project schedule and result in additional fees, for which Customer shall be solely responsible. Provider reserves the right to adjust its professional services rates upon thirty (30) days' notice, provided that such adjustments shall not apply to SOWs executed prior to the effective date of the rate change.

12.3 Customer Obligations and Performance Dependencies. The Provider’s performance of Professional Services is strictly conditioned upon the Customer’s timely and effective fulfillment of its responsibilities. Customer shall (i) assign a dedicated project manager with appropriate decision-making authority; (ii) provide timely and unrestricted access to relevant personnel, facilities, systems, and data; (iii) ensure the accuracy and completeness of all Customer-provided information; and (iv) perform any specific Customer obligations identified in the SOW. Provider shall be excused from any failure or delay in performance to the extent caused by Customer’s acts, omissions, or failure to satisfy its dependencies. Any additional costs or labor hours incurred by Provider due to Customer-related delays or non-performance shall be invoiced to Customer at Provider's then-current professional services rates.

12.4 Deliverable Acceptance and Remediation. Upon the delivery of any specific deliverable, milestone, or work product identified in an SOW (each, a “Deliverable”), Customer shall have a period of five (5) business days (the “Acceptance Period”) to conduct testing and review for material compliance with the agreed-upon specifications set forth in the SOW. If Customer identifies a material non-conformity, it must provide a detailed written notice of deficiency to Provider within the Acceptance Period. Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to rectify the non-conformity and redeliver the Deliverable for further review. In the absence of a written notice of deficiency within the Acceptance Period, or upon any unauthorized use of the Deliverable in a production environment, the Deliverable shall be deemed irrevocably accepted by the Customer.

12.5 Intellectual Property Rights and License Grant. Except as otherwise explicitly stipulated in a signed SOW, the Provider retains all right, title, and interest in and to the Professional Services, Deliverables, and all underlying intellectual property, methodologies, processes, scripts, and software code utilized or created during the performance of the services (collectively, “Provider IP”). Upon full payment of all fees due under the applicable SOW, Provider grants to Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, royalty-free license to use the Deliverables solely for Customer’s internal business purposes in connection with the underlying services provided under this Agreement. This Agreement does not create a "work made for hire" relationship, and all rights not expressly granted herein are reserved by the Provider.

12.6 Personnel Management and Non-Solicitation. Provider shall maintain absolute discretion over the selection, assignment, and management of personnel and subcontractors utilized in the performance of Professional Services. Customer shall not, during the term of any active SOW and for a period of twelve (12) months following the completion or termination thereof, directly or indirectly solicit for employment, hire, or engage as an independent contractor any employee or contractor of Provider who was involved in the delivery of the Professional Services. In the event of a breach of this restrictive covenant, Customer shall pay to Provider, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the hired individual’s most recent annual base salary or annualized consulting fee.

12.7 Service Level Warranty and Exclusive Remedy. Provider warrants that the Professional Services shall be performed in a professional and workmanlike manner consistent with generally accepted industry standards. Any claim for breach of this warranty must be submitted in writing within thirty (30) days of the performance of the specific service. Provider’s sole liability, and Customer’s exclusive remedy for a breach of this warranty, shall be the re-performance of the non-conforming services by Provider at no additional cost to Customer, or, at Provider’s sole election, a pro-rata refund of the fees paid for the non-conforming portion of the services. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THIS WARRANTY IS IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.

12.8 Compensation and Expense Reimbursement. Customer shall compensate Provider for Professional Services in accordance with the fee structure set forth in the SOW, which may be on a fixed-fee or time-and-materials basis. Unless otherwise stated, all Professional Services are provided on a time-and-materials basis. Customer shall reimburse Provider for all reasonable, pre-approved out-of-pocket expenses, including travel, lodging, and per diem costs, incurred in the performance of the services. All payments are non-refundable and shall be made in accordance with the payment terms established in the Master Agreement.

12.9 Termination of SOW. Either party may terminate an SOW for cause if the other party commits a material breach and fails to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of receiving written notice thereof. Termination of an individual SOW shall not affect the validity of this Master Agreement or any other outstanding SOWs. Upon termination of an SOW for any reason, Customer shall remain liable for all fees for services performed and expenses incurred through the effective date of termination, including any costs associated with the orderly wind-down of the project and the preservation of work-in-progress.

## 13. Customer Obligations and Technical Requirements

13. CUSTOMER OBLIGATIONS AND TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

13.1 General Compliance and Conduct. The Customer shall at all times comply with all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, statutes, ordinances, and regulations in its use of the Services. The Customer warrants and represents that it possesses the full legal authority, corporate power, and all necessary rights and licenses to enter into this Agreement and to fulfill the obligations set forth herein.

13.5 Accuracy and Maintenance of Information. The Customer represents and warrants that all information provided to the Provider—including registration data, billing information, tax identification, and administrative contact details—is accurate, current, and complete. The Customer assumes an ongoing obligation to promptly update such information via the Service’s administrative interface or by written notice to the Provider to ensure its continued accuracy.

13.6 Cooperation and Access Rights. The Customer shall provide all reasonable cooperation, information, and assistance to the Provider as may be required for the Provider’s performance of its obligations under this Agreement. This includes, without limitation, providing timely access to Customer Data, necessary personnel, and technical infrastructure when required for troubleshooting, configuration, integration, or security audits. The Customer shall comply with all operational policies, acceptable use policies (AUP), and end-user guidelines published by the Provider, which are hereby incorporated into this Agreement by reference.

13.7 Prohibited Technical Activities and System Integrity. The Customer shall not, and shall not permit any third party to: (a) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code, underlying ideas, or algorithms of the Services; (b) use the Services to store, host, or transmit malicious code, logic bombs, worms, or other harmful software components; (c) interfere with or disrupt the integrity, security, or performance of the Services or the data contained therein; (d) attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Services, its related systems, or its underlying networks through hacking, password mining, or any other means; or (e) employ any automated system, including "robots," "spiders," or "offline readers," to access the Services in a manner that exceeds reasonable usage patterns or imposes an undue burden on the Provider's infrastructure.

13.8 Responsibility for Customer Content. The Customer assumes sole responsibility for the legality, reliability, integrity, and quality of any data, text, images, or other materials uploaded, processed, or stored within the Services by the Customer or its authorized users ("Customer Content"). The Customer shall ensure that it has obtained all necessary consents and permissions required by law to process such Customer Content. The Provider exercises no control over, and accepts no responsibility for, the content of any data transmitted through the Services by the Customer.

13.9 Consequences of Default and Indemnification. Any failure by the Customer to strictly fulfill the obligations set forth in this Section 13 shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement. In the event of such a breach, the Provider reserves the right, in its sole discretion and without prejudice to any other rights or remedies available at law or in equity, to suspend or terminate the Customer’s access to the Services immediately and without prior notice. The Customer shall indemnify, defend, and hold the Provider harmless from and against any and all claims, damages, liabilities, losses, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of or related to the Customer's failure to adhere to the technical requirements, security obligations, or prohibited conduct provisions specified herein.

## 14. Fees, Billing Schedules, and Payment Terms

14. FEES, BILLING SCHEDULES, AND PAYMENT TERMS

14.1 Fee Structure and Compensation. In consideration for the performance of the Services and the provision of any Deliverables set forth in this Agreement or any applicable Statement of Work (SOW), the Client shall pay to the Contractor the fees specified therein (the “Fees”). Fees may be structured as fixed-fee engagements, milestone-based payments, or on a time-and-materials basis at the Contractor’s then-current hourly rates, as expressly defined in the relevant SOW. Unless otherwise explicitly stated in writing, all Fees are quoted in United States Dollars and are non-refundable and non-cancelable upon the commencement of the Services.

14.2 Taxes and Statutory Impositions. All Fees are exclusive of any and all applicable federal, state, local, and foreign taxes, duties, tariffs, levies, or assessments, including but not limited to sales, use, value-added (VAT), goods and services (GST), excise, or withholding taxes (collectively, “Taxes”). The Client shall be solely responsible for the payment of all such Taxes associated with the purchase of Services hereunder, excluding only those taxes based strictly upon the Contractor’s net income, corporate franchise, or employment obligations. If the Client is legally required to withhold any portion of the Fees under any tax law, the Client shall gross up the relevant payment such that the Contractor receives the full amount intended as if no such withholding had been required, and shall provide the Contractor with official tax receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority.

14.3 Reimbursable Expenses. The Client shall reimburse the Contractor for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the direct performance of the Services, including but not limited to travel, lodging, subsistence, telecommunications, and third-party postage or courier charges (“Reimbursable Expenses”). All travel-related expenses shall be subject to the Client’s prior written approval and shall be governed by the Contractor’s standard travel policy unless otherwise agreed. Reimbursable Expenses shall be invoiced at cost without markup and shall be due and payable in accordance with the payment terms set forth herein.

14.4 Invoicing Procedures and Billing Schedules. The Contractor shall issue invoices to the Client in accordance with the billing schedule stipulated in the SOW. In the absence of a specific billing schedule, the Contractor shall invoice the Client monthly in arrears for Services rendered and expenses incurred. Each invoice shall set forth in reasonable detail the nature of the Services performed, the applicable Fees, and any Reimbursable Expenses. Invoices shall be delivered electronically to the Client’s designated billing contact.

14.5 Payment Terms and Method of Payment. All undisputed Fees and expenses shall be due and payable within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the invoice (the “Due Date”). Payment shall be made in the currency specified in the invoice via ACH transfer, wire transfer, or such other electronic payment method as the Contractor may designate. All payments must be made in full without any set-off, counterclaim, deduction, or withholding of any kind.

14.6 Late Payments and Interest Accrual. Any amount not paid by the Due Date shall be subject to a late payment charge equal to the lesser of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month (18% per annum) or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, calculated daily and compounded monthly from the Due Date until the date of actual payment. In addition to such interest, the Client shall be liable for all costs of collection, including reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and collection agency fees, incurred by the Contractor in recovering any delinquent amounts.

14.7 Payment Disputes. If the Client disputes any portion of an invoice in good faith, the Client must provide written notice to the Contractor within ten (10) business days of the invoice date, specifying the exact nature of the dispute and the amount withheld. The Client shall timely pay all undisputed portions of the invoice. Failure to provide such notice within the prescribed period shall constitute an irrevocable waiver of the Client’s right to dispute the invoice and a conclusive admission of the validity and liquidated nature of the debt. The parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any timely disputed amounts within fifteen (15) business days of the notice of dispute.

14.8 Suspension of Services for Non-Payment. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Contractor reserves the right to suspend the performance of Services and the delivery of any Deliverables, and to withhold access to any proprietary systems or data, if any invoice remains unpaid for more than fifteen (15) days beyond its Due Date. Such suspension shall not constitute a termination of the Agreement nor shall it relieve the Client of its obligation to pay all Fees and interest due. The Contractor shall not be liable for any damages, losses, or delays incurred by the Client or any third party resulting from such suspension of Services.

14.9 Fee Adjustments and Escalation. The Contractor reserves the right to adjust its standard hourly rates and fee schedules upon sixty (60) days’ prior written notice to the Client. For multi-year engagements or recurring service contracts, the Fees shall be subject to an automatic annual escalation equal to the greater of five percent (5%) or the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI-U) for the preceding twelve-month period, unless otherwise restricted by an applicable SOW. Any such adjustment shall apply to all Services performed after the effective date of the adjustment.

## 15. Taxes, Duties, and Tax Exemptions

15. TAXES, DUTIES, AND TAX EXEMPTIONS

15.1 General Responsibility for Taxes. The Contractor shall be solely responsible for the payment of all taxes, assessments, levies, duties, fees, and other charges of any kind, including but not limited to income, profits, franchise, gross receipts, payroll, social security, workers' compensation, and unemployment taxes, together with any interest and penalties related thereto (collectively, "Taxes"), imposed by any local, state, federal, or international taxing authority arising out of or in connection with the performance of its obligations under this Agreement.

15.2 Indirect Taxes and VAT. All prices, fees, and other amounts payable by the Client to the Contractor under this Agreement are exclusive of value-added tax (VAT), sales and use tax, goods and services tax (GST), or any other similar transactional taxes now or hereafter levied by any governmental authority. Where such Taxes are legally applicable, the Contractor shall separately itemize them on its invoices, and the Client shall pay such amounts to the Contractor, provided that the Contractor provides a valid tax invoice in compliance with the relevant statutory requirements of the jurisdiction to enable the Client to claim any applicable input tax credits or refunds.

15.3 Withholding Taxes. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, if the Client is required by any applicable law, treaty, or regulation to withhold or deduct any portion of the payments due to the Contractor as Taxes, the Client shall be entitled to deduct such amounts from the gross payment and remit them to the appropriate taxing authority. The Client shall provide the Contractor with official receipts or other evidence of such payment as may be reasonably requested. In such an event, the sum payable by the Client shall be the amount remaining after such deduction or withholding, and the Client shall not be required to "gross up" any payments or pay any additional amounts to the Contractor to compensate for such withholding.

15.4 Tax Exemptions and Documentation. Should the Client be entitled to any tax exemption, or should the transactions contemplated herein be subject to a zero-rate or specific exemption under applicable law, the Client shall provide the Contractor with a valid and duly executed tax exemption certificate or other documentation required by the relevant taxing authority. Upon receipt and verification of such documentation, the Contractor shall cease to charge such Taxes to the Client. The Contractor shall cooperate fully with the Client in obtaining any available tax exemptions, refunds, or credits.

15.5 Customs, Duties, and Import/Export Levies. The Contractor shall be liable for all customs duties, tariffs, excise taxes, and any other import or export charges associated with the cross-border movement of goods, software, or equipment necessary for the fulfillment of this Agreement.

15.6 Tax Indemnification. The Contractor hereby agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold the Client harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of or resulting from the Contractor’s failure to report or pay any Taxes for which it is responsible under this Agreement or applicable law. This indemnification obligation shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.

15.7 Tax Cooperation. The Parties agree to cooperate in good faith and provide each other with such information and documentation as may be reasonably necessary to comply with their respective tax obligations, to minimize tax liabilities in accordance with applicable law, and to respond to any audits or inquiries by taxing authorities related to the subject matter of this Agreement. Each Party shall bear its own costs in relation to such cooperation.

## 16. Price Adjustments and Renewal Pricing Caps

16. Price Adjustments and Renewal Pricing Caps.

16.1 Annual Fee Adjustments. Upon the expiration of the Initial Term and at the commencement of each subsequent Renewal Term, the Provider reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to adjust the Fees payable for the Services. Such adjustments shall be applied to the baseline pricing established in the most recent Order Form or Service Agreement and shall be reflective of changes in market conditions, operational overhead, and service enhancements. 

16.2 Renewal Pricing Cap. Notwithstanding the discretionary nature of Fee adjustments set forth in Section 16.1, the total increase in Fees for any Renewal Term shall not exceed the greater of: (i) five percent (5%) over the Fees charged during the immediately preceding twelve (12) month period; or (ii) the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), U.S. City Average, as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor, for the twelve (12) month period ending sixty (60) days prior to the commencement of the applicable Renewal Term. In the event the Consumer Price Index ceases to be published, the Provider may substitute a reasonably comparable index to determine the adjustment.

16.3 Notice of Adjustment. The Provider shall deliver written notice of any proposed Fee adjustment to the Customer no later than ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the then-current Term. Failure of the Provider to provide such notice within the specified timeframe shall result in the Fees for the subsequent Renewal Term remaining at the rates applicable during the preceding Term, unless otherwise agreed upon in writing by the Parties.

16.4 Scope of Caps. The pricing caps established in Section 16.2 are applicable only to the recurring subscription or licensing fees for the specific Services and seat counts authorized in the preceding Term. These caps shall not apply to, and the Provider specifically reserves the right to adjust without limitation: (a) pass-through costs for third-party integrations, APIs, or licensing fees; (b) variable usage-based charges or overage fees; (c) professional services, consulting, or implementation fees; and (d) any additional modules, features, or seats added by the Customer during the Renewal Term, which shall be invoiced at the then-current list price.

16.5 Tax and Regulatory Adjustments. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 16, the Provider may, upon thirty (30) days’ notice, increase Fees as necessary to compensate for any newly enacted or modified federal, state, or local taxes, duties, or regulatory assessments imposed upon the Provider’s delivery of the Services, provided that such adjustments are applied uniformly to all similarly situated customers.

16.6 Customer Acceptance. The Customer’s continued use of the Services following the commencement of a Renewal Term, or the Customer’s failure to provide a timely notice of non-renewal in accordance with the termination provisions of this Agreement after receiving a notice of Fee adjustment, shall constitute the Customer’s irrevocable acceptance of the adjusted Fees. All adjusted Fees shall be payable in accordance with the payment terms set forth in the Agreement.

## 17. Fee Disputes and Financial Audit Rights

17. FEE DISPUTES AND FINANCIAL AUDIT RIGHTS

17.1 Notice of Dispute and Payment Obligations. In the event that the Client, in good faith, disputes any portion of an invoice submitted by the Provider, the Client shall provide written notice to the Provider within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of receipt of the applicable invoice. Such notice shall detail with specificity the line items or amounts in dispute and the factual or contractual basis for such dispute. The Client’s failure to provide such notice within the aforementioned timeframe shall be deemed an irrevocable waiver of the Client’s right to challenge the accuracy or validity of the charges set forth in the invoice and shall constitute an absolute admission of the debt. Notwithstanding any ongoing dispute, the Client shall remain obligated to pay all undisputed amounts on the invoice by the original payment due date specified herein. No set-off, recoupment, or withholding of undisputed payments shall be permitted.

17.2 Dispute Resolution Process. Upon the Provider’s receipt of a timely dispute notice, both parties shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts and act in good faith to resolve the discrepancy through executive-level negotiations within thirty (30) business days. If the parties are unable to reach a resolution within this period, the disputed amount shall be subject to the formal dispute resolution and governing law provisions of this Agreement. Late payment interest, as defined in the payment terms of this Agreement, shall accrue on any disputed amounts that are subsequently determined to be validly owed to the Provider, calculated from the original due date until the date of actual payment.

17.3 Record Retention and Maintenance. Throughout the term of this Agreement and for a period of three (3) years following its termination or expiration, the Provider shall maintain comprehensive, accurate, and systematic books, records, and accounts pertaining to the services rendered, billable hours, reimbursable expenses, and all financial transactions related to this Agreement (collectively, "Financial Records"). All such records shall be maintained in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) or International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as applicable.

17.4 Audit Rights and Procedures. The Client, or an independent third-party auditor of the Client’s choosing who is not a direct competitor of the Provider and who is subject to a written confidentiality agreement, shall have the right, upon no less than fourteen (14) business days’ prior written notice, to inspect, examine, and audit the Provider’s Financial Records to verify compliance with the financial terms and billing obligations of this Agreement. Any such audit shall be conducted during the Provider’s normal business hours, at the Provider’s principal place of business, and in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the Provider’s business operations. Audit rights may be exercised no more than once per twelve (12) month period, unless a prior audit has revealed a material discrepancy.

17.5 Audit Costs and Financial Reconciliation. The costs and expenses associated with the performance of any such audit shall be borne solely by the Client. However, if any audit reveals an overcharge by the Provider exceeding five percent (5%) of the total fees billed for the period subject to the audit, the Provider shall, within thirty (30) calendar days of the audit report’s issuance: (a) reimburse the Client for the reasonable, documented out-of-pocket costs of the audit; and (b) remit to the Client the full amount of the overcharge, plus interest at the rate of one percent (1%) per month or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower. Conversely, if the audit reveals an undercharge, the Client shall remit the deficiency to the Provider within thirty (30) calendar days of receiving the audit findings.

17.6 Confidentiality of Audit Results. All information obtained during the course of an audit, including the final audit report and all working papers, shall be treated as strictly Confidential Information under the terms of this Agreement and shall not be disclosed to any third party, except as required by law or to the extent necessary to enforce the rights of either party under this Section 17. The findings of the audit shall be final and binding upon the parties in the absence of manifest error.

## 22. Confidentiality: Definition and Scope

22. CONFIDENTIALITY: DEFINITION AND SCOPE

22.1 Definition of Confidential Information. For the purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential Information" shall mean any and all non-public, proprietary, or sensitive information, whether disclosed orally, visually, in writing, or in electronic, machine-readable, or other tangible or intangible form, and whether or not specifically labeled or otherwise identified as "confidential" or "proprietary," that is disclosed by one Party (the "Disclosing Party") to the other Party (the "Receiving Party"), or its Representatives (as defined below), before, on, or after the Effective Date. Confidential Information includes, without limitation: (a) all technical information, trade secrets, know-how, inventions, discoveries, improvements, techniques, processes, formulas, software (including source code, object code, and related documentation), algorithms, designs, schematics, architectures, and data; (b) all business, commercial, and financial information, including pricing, cost structures, profit margins, financial projections, business plans, marketing and sales strategies, customer lists, vendor and supplier data, and personnel records; (c) the specific terms, conditions, and existence of this Agreement; and (d) any other information that, by its nature or the circumstances surrounding its disclosure, a reasonable person in a similar industry would understand to be confidential or proprietary.

22.2 Exclusions from Confidential Information. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 22.1, Confidential Information shall not include information that the Receiving Party can demonstrate by written evidence: (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a breach of this Agreement or any other confidentiality obligation by the Receiving Party or its Representatives; (ii) was already in the possession of the Receiving Party or its Representatives at the time of disclosure by the Disclosing Party without an obligation of confidentiality; (iii) is obtained by the Receiving Party or its Representatives on a non-confidential basis from a third party who is not, to the Receiving Party’s knowledge, prohibited from disclosing such information by a legal, contractual, or fiduciary obligation to the Disclosing Party; or (iv) is independently developed by or on behalf of the Receiving Party without the use of, reference to, or reliance upon any of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.

22.3 Mandatory Disclosure. If the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives is required by law, regulation, stock exchange rule, or a valid order of a court or other governmental or regulatory body to disclose any Confidential Information, the Receiving Party shall, to the extent legally permissible, provide the Disclosing Party with prompt written notice of such requirement so that the Disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy at its own expense. If no such protective order or other remedy is obtained, or if the Disclosing Party waives compliance with the terms of this Section, the Receiving Party or its Representative shall disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information that it is advised by legal counsel is legally required to be disclosed and shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to the information so disclosed.

22.4 Scope of Use and Non-Disclosure Obligations. The Receiving Party shall: (a) use the Confidential Information solely for the purpose of exercising its rights and performing its obligations under this Agreement (the "Permitted Purpose"); (b) maintain the Confidential Information in strict confidence and protect such information from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure using the same degree of care that it uses to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature, but in no event less than a commercially reasonable degree of care; and (c) restrict access to and disclosure of the Confidential Information to those of its and its affiliates' employees, officers, directors, consultants, and legal, tax, or financial advisors (collectively, "Representatives") who have a bona fide "need to know" such information for the Permitted Purpose and who are bound by confidentiality obligations (whether by contract or professional duty) at least as restrictive as those set forth in this Section 22. The Receiving Party shall be responsible for any breach of this Section 22 by any of its Representatives.

22.5 Ownership and Return of Materials. All Confidential Information remains the sole and exclusive property of the Disclosing Party. The disclosure of Confidential Information hereunder shall not be construed as granting, by implication, estoppel, or otherwise, any license or right under any patent, trademark, copyright, or other intellectual property right, except for the limited right to use such information for the Permitted Purpose. Upon the written request of the Disclosing Party, or upon the expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason, the Receiving Party shall, at the Disclosing Party’s option, either promptly return to the Disclosing Party or securely destroy all copies and embodiments of the Confidential Information in its possession or control, including all extracts, summaries, and adaptations thereof, and shall, upon request, provide a written certification signed by an officer of the Receiving Party confirming compliance with this Section 22.5; provided, however, that the Receiving Party may retain one copy of the Confidential Information to the extent required by applicable law or bona fide internal record retention policies, subject to the continued application of the confidentiality obligations herein.

## 23. Obligations of Non-Disclosure and Non-Use

23. Obligations of Non-Disclosure and Non-Use.

23.1 Duty of Confidentiality. The Receiving Party acknowledges that, by virtue of this Agreement, it may be entrusted with or otherwise gain access to Confidential Information belonging to the Disclosing Party. The Receiving Party shall hold all such Confidential Information in the strictest confidence and shall use at least the same degree of care—but in no event less than a commercially reasonable standard of care—as it uses to protect its own confidential and proprietary information of a similar nature to prevent the unauthorized access, use, dissemination, or publication of the Confidential Information. The Receiving Party shall not disclose any Confidential Information to any third party except as expressly permitted under the terms of this Section 23.

23.2 Restrictive Use. The Receiving Party shall utilize the Confidential Information solely for the purpose of exercising its rights and fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement (the "Permitted Purpose"). The Receiving Party is expressly prohibited from using, exploiting, or otherwise leveraging the Confidential Information for its own benefit, for the benefit of any third party, or for any purpose detrimental to the interests of the Disclosing Party, including but not limited to the development of products or services that compete with the Disclosing Party’s offerings. No license, express or implied, in the Confidential Information or any associated intellectual property rights is granted to the Receiving Party beyond the limited right of use for the Permitted Purpose.

23.3 Authorized Disclosure to Representatives. The Receiving Party may disclose the Confidential Information only to those of its directors, officers, employees, consultants, and professional advisors (collectively, "Representatives") who have a definitive "need to know" such information for the Permitted Purpose. Prior to any such disclosure, the Receiving Party shall ensure that such Representatives are bound by written confidentiality obligations at least as stringent as those contained herein. The Receiving Party shall remain primarily liable for any act or omission by its Representatives that would constitute a breach of this Agreement if performed by the Receiving Party.

23.4 Exclusions. The obligations of non-disclosure and non-use set forth herein shall not apply to any information which the Receiving Party can demonstrate by clear and convincing contemporaneous written evidence: (a) was already in the public domain at the time of disclosure or subsequently enters the public domain through no fault, act, or omission of the Receiving Party or its Representatives; (b) was rightfully in the Receiving Party’s possession prior to disclosure by the Disclosing Party, free of any obligation of confidentiality; (c) is obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party who is not, to the Receiving Party’s knowledge, under any duty of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party; or (d) was independently developed by the Receiving Party without any use of or reference to the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.

23.5 Compelled Disclosure. If the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives are required by law, regulation, judicial order, or valid subpoena to disclose any Confidential Information, the Receiving Party shall, to the extent legally permissible, provide the Disclosing Party with prompt written notice of such requirement so that the Disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy. If, in the absence of a protective order, the Receiving Party is nonetheless legally compelled to disclose such information, the Receiving Party shall disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information which its legal counsel advises it is strictly required to disclose and shall exercise reasonable efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to the information so disclosed.

23.6 Return or Destruction of Confidential Information. Upon the written request of the Disclosing Party, or immediately upon the expiration or termination of this Agreement, the Receiving Party shall, at the Disclosing Party’s sole option: (i) return all originals and copies of the Confidential Information in its possession, custody, or control; or (ii) permanently destroy all such Confidential Information, including the deletion of all electronic files and the shredding of all physical documents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party may retain one copy of the Confidential Information solely for archival or compliance purposes, or as required by its standard automated electronic backup procedures, provided that such retained information remains subject to the confidentiality obligations of this Agreement until it is eventually deleted or destroyed.

23.7 Injunctive Relief and Survival. The Receiving Party acknowledges that any breach of this Section 23 may cause the Disclosing Party irreparable harm for which monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy. Accordingly, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief, specific performance, and other equitable remedies to enforce the provisions of this Section 23 without the necessity of posting a bond or proving actual damages, in addition to all other remedies available at law. The obligations of non-disclosure and non-use shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement for a period of five (5) years; provided, however, that with respect to any Confidential Information constituting a trade secret under applicable law, such obligations shall survive for as long as the information remains a trade secret.

## 24. Exceptions to Confidential Information

24. EXCEPTIONS TO CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. Notwithstanding any other provision contained within this Agreement, the obligations of confidentiality and non-use shall not apply to any information that the Receiving Party can demonstrate by competent written evidence: (a) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by the Receiving Party or its Representatives in violation of this Agreement or any other applicable duty of confidentiality; (b) was already known to or in the possession of the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis prior to its disclosure by or on behalf of the Disclosing Party; (c) is or becomes available to the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Disclosing Party, provided that such source is not known by the Receiving Party, after reasonable inquiry, to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with, or other contractual, legal, or fiduciary obligation of secrecy to, the Disclosing Party or any other party with respect to such information; (d) is independently developed by or on behalf of the Receiving Party without the use of, reference to, or reliance upon any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party; or (e) is explicitly approved for release or disclosure by the Disclosing Party via prior written authorization. Furthermore, the Receiving Party shall not be prohibited from disclosing Confidential Information to the extent such disclosure is required by a valid order of a court of competent jurisdiction or other governmental, regulatory, or administrative body, or is otherwise required by law, regulation, or the rules of any recognized stock exchange; provided, however, that in such an event, the Receiving Party shall, to the extent legally permissible: (i) provide the Disclosing Party with prompt written notice of such requirement so that the Disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy; (ii) consult with the Disclosing Party on the advisability of taking legally available steps to resist or narrow such requirement; and (iii) disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information that it is legally compelled to disclose, and exercise all reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to the Confidential Information so disclosed. Any Information that is a combination of individual items of information shall not be deemed to be within any of the foregoing exceptions merely because one or more of the individual items are within such exceptions, unless the combination itself is within such exceptions.

## 25. Data Protection and Privacy Compliance (GDPR/CCPA)

25. DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY COMPLIANCE (GDPR/CCPA)

25.1 Compliance Obligations. Both Parties shall, at all times and at their own expense, comply with all applicable statutes, regulations, orders, and data protection laws relating to the collection, use, storage, transfer, and processing of personal data or personally identifiable information ("Personal Data") including, without limitation, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 ("GDPR"), the UK General Data Protection Regulation, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (Cal.

## 26. Information Security Standards and Safeguards

26. INFORMATION SECURITY STANDARDS AND SAFEGUARDS

26.1 Maintenance of Security Program. During the Term of this Agreement, the Provider shall implement, maintain, and enforce a comprehensive, written information security program (the "Security Program") comprising administrative, physical, and technical safeguards designed to: (i) ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Company Data; (ii) protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of Company Data; and (iii) protect against unauthorized access to, or use or disclosure of, Company Data.

Provider shall ensure that all software, operating systems, and firmware are maintained at current, supported versions and that security patches are applied in a timely manner according to a risk-based prioritization schedule.

26.6 Incident Response and Notification. Provider shall maintain a formal Incident Response Plan (IRP) to detect, investigate, and respond to potential Security Incidents. In the event of a "Security Incident"—defined as any unauthorized access, acquisition, disclosure, loss, or destruction of Company Data—Provider shall notify the Company in writing without undue delay, and in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours after discovery. Such notification shall include a description of the nature of the incident, the categories of data affected, and the remedial actions taken or proposed. Provider shall cooperate fully with Company’s investigation and shall be responsible for all costs associated with remediation, notification, and credit monitoring services if the incident resulted from Provider’s negligence or breach of this Section.

26.7 Audit Rights and Compliance. Provider shall, upon written request and no more than once per calendar year (unless following a Security Incident), provide Company with copies of its most recent third-party audit reports (e.g., SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001 certification). Company, or an independent third-party auditor designated by Company, shall have the right, upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours, to conduct an on-site audit of Provider’s security practices and facilities to verify compliance with the obligations set forth in this Section 26.

26.8 Subcontractor Compliance. Provider shall not disclose Company Data to any subcontractor or third-party service provider unless such entity is bound by written contractual obligations no less restrictive than those set forth in this Section. Provider shall remain primarily liable for any act or omission of its subcontractors that results in a breach of these Information Security Standards.

26.9 Data Disposal and Return. Upon the expiration or termination of this Agreement, or at any time upon Company’s written request, Provider shall, at Company's election, either return all Company Data in a mutually agreed-upon format or securely destroy such data. Destruction shall be performed in a manner that renders the data unrecoverable (e.g., NIST 800-88 standards for media sanitization). Provider shall provide a written certification of such destruction or return within ten (10) business days of the request.

## 27. Security Incident Response and Breach Notification

27. SECURITY INCIDENT RESPONSE AND BREACH NOTIFICATION

27.1 Definitions. For the purposes of this Agreement, a "Security Incident" shall mean any suspected or actual unauthorized access to, acquisition of, disclosure of, loss of, destruction of, or compromise to the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of Protected Data or the information technology systems utilized by a Party to process such data. A "Data Breach" shall refer to a Security Incident that meets the threshold for notification to a regulatory authority or affected data subjects under applicable Data Protection Laws.

27.2 Incident Response Program. Each Party represents and warrants that it maintains and shall continue to maintain a formal, written incident response plan (“IRP”) that outlines the procedures for detecting, containing, investigating, and remediating Security Incidents. Such IRP shall be reviewed and tested at least annually to ensure its efficacy. Each Party shall ensure that its personnel are adequately trained in the execution of the IRP and that necessary resources are allocated to respond to potential threats in a timely and professional manner.

27.3 Notification Obligations. Upon the discovery of any Security Incident, the Party experiencing the incident (the “Reporting Party”) shall notify the other Party (the “Non-Reporting Party”) without undue delay, and in no event later than forty-eight (48) hours following the initial discovery of the incident. Such notification shall be delivered via the primary notice methods established in Section [X] of this Agreement and shall be followed by a written report providing a comprehensive overview of the event.

27.4 Content of Notification. To the extent the information is available at the time of disclosure, the Reporting Party’s notification shall include: (a) the nature of the Security Incident, including the categories and approximate number of data subjects and records concerned; (b) the date and time the incident occurred and was discovered; (c) the likely consequences and potential risks posed by the incident; (d) the identity of the unauthorized person(s) who accessed or acquired the data, if known; and (e) a detailed description of the measures taken or proposed to be taken by the Reporting Party to address the Security Incident and mitigate its potential adverse effects. The Reporting Party shall provide ongoing updates as additional information becomes available through its forensic investigation.

27.5 Investigation and Remediation. Immediately following the discovery of a Security Incident, the Reporting Party shall, at its sole expense: (a) conduct a thorough forensic investigation to determine the scope and cause of the incident; (b) take all necessary and immediate steps to contain the incident and prevent further unauthorized activity; (c) implement remedial measures to address the underlying vulnerabilities; and (d) preserve all evidence, including system logs and forensic images, relevant to the incident for a period of no less than three (3) years or until the conclusion of any related litigation or regulatory investigation.

27.6 Cooperation and Regulatory Compliance. The Parties shall cooperate in good faith to investigate the Security Incident. The Reporting Party shall provide the Non-Reporting Party with such assistance as is reasonably necessary to enable the Non-Reporting Party to comply with its legal obligations, including providing information for regulatory filings and assisting in the drafting of notices to data subjects. Unless otherwise required by mandatory provisions of law, the Reporting Party shall not issue any public statements, press releases, or notifications to regulatory bodies that identify the Non-Reporting Party without the Non-Reporting Party’s prior written consent.

27.7 Allocation of Costs. The Reporting Party shall be responsible for all costs and expenses incurred in connection with its performance of the obligations set forth in this Section 27, including but not limited to costs related to: (a) forensic investigations; (b) legal fees and regulatory fines; (c) the provision of notice to affected data subjects; and (d) the provision of credit monitoring or identity theft restoration services where such services are required by law or deemed commercially reasonable under the circumstances.

27.8 Post-Incident Evaluation. Following the resolution of a Security Incident, the Reporting Party shall conduct a "root cause analysis" and provide a written summary of its findings to the Non-Reporting Party. The Reporting Party shall promptly implement any reasonable security enhancements or procedural changes identified during the analysis to prevent a recurrence of the incident. Failure to implement such enhancements within a reasonable timeframe shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement.

## 28. Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Planning

28. Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Planning

28.1 Maintenance of Plans. The Service Provider represents, warrants, and covenants that it has established and shall maintain throughout the Term of this Agreement a comprehensive, written Business Continuity Plan (“BCP”) and Disaster Recovery Plan (“DRP”) designed to ensure the continued availability of the Services and the integrity and security of Client Data in the event of a Disaster. For purposes of this Section, a “Disaster” shall be defined as any unplanned interruption of the Service Provider’s business processes, information technology systems, or infrastructure, whether caused by natural phenomena, public health emergencies, acts of terrorism, cyber-attacks, power outages, or other Force Majeure events, which results in a material degradation or cessation of the Services.

28.2 Minimum Standards and Scope. The BCP and DRP shall, at a minimum: (a) identify critical personnel, systems, and facilities necessary for the performance of the Services; (b) provide for the regular, redundant backup of Client Data to geographically diverse, secure off-site locations; (c) establish failover protocols to secondary processing environments; and (d) include detailed procedures for the restoration of technical infrastructure and business operations. The Service Provider shall ensure that its subcontractors and third-party service providers essential to the delivery of Services maintain disaster recovery capabilities consistent with the requirements set forth herein.

28.3 Recovery Objectives. The Service Provider shall adhere to the following recovery metrics: (i) a Recovery Time Objective (“RTO”) not to exceed four (4) hours from the declaration of a Disaster; and (ii) a Recovery Point Objective (“RPO”) not to exceed one (1) hour of data loss. Failure to meet these objectives shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement, entitling the Client to all remedies available at law or equity, including the immediate right of termination for cause without a cure period.

28.4 Periodic Testing and Audit. No less than once every twelve (12) calendar months, the Service Provider shall conduct comprehensive testing and simulation of its BCP and DRP to verify the effectiveness of its recovery procedures and its ability to meet the RTO and RPO requirements. Upon the Client’s written request, the Service Provider shall provide a summary report of the most recent test results, including any identified deficiencies and a documented remediation plan for such deficiencies. The Client or its designated independent auditor shall have the right, upon reasonable notice, to inspect and audit the Service Provider’s BCP and DRP documentation and testing logs.

28.5 Activation and Notification. In the event of a Disaster, the Service Provider shall: (a) immediately activate the BCP and DRP; (b) notify the Client’s primary point of contact via telephone and electronic mail within two (2) hours of the occurrence or identification of the Disaster; and (c) provide the Client with frequent status updates (at intervals of no less than four hours) regarding the progress of restoration efforts until the Services are fully restored to the baseline levels required by the applicable Service Level Agreements.

28.6 Relationship to Force Majeure. Notwithstanding any provision in the Force Majeure clause of this Agreement to the contrary, a Force Majeure event shall not excuse the Service Provider from its obligations to implement the BCP and DRP. The Service Provider’s failure to maintain or implement the BCP and DRP in accordance with this Section 28 shall preclude the Service Provider from asserting a Force Majeure defense for any resulting failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

28.7 Data Integrity and Validation. Following the restoration of Services after a Disaster, the Service Provider shall perform comprehensive data integrity checks and validation procedures to ensure that all Client Data has been recovered accurately and without corruption. Any discrepancies or data loss identified during this process must be reported to the Client immediately and remediated at the Service Provider's sole cost and expense.

28.8 Site Diversification. The Service Provider shall maintain secondary facilities for the processing of Client Data and the provision of Services that are located at a sufficient geographical distance from the primary production facility to ensure they are not susceptible to the same localized Disaster event. Such secondary facilities shall be maintained in a state of readiness to assume production workloads within the RTO specified herein.

## 29. Third-Party Audits and Security Certifications

29. Third-Party Audits and Security Certifications

29.1 Standards and Maintenance of Certifications. The Company represents and warrants that it shall maintain, throughout the Term of this Agreement, a comprehensive information security program (the "Security Program") consistent with prevailing industry standards and applicable legal requirements. The Company shall maintain, at its sole cost and expense, one or more of the following certifications or attestations: (i) Service Organization Control (SOC) 2 Type II; (ii) ISO/IEC 27001:2022; (iii) PCI DSS (if applicable to the handling of payment card data); or (iv) a substantially equivalent, industry-recognized security framework. The Company shall ensure that its Security Program is designed to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Customer Data against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.

29.2 Annual Independent Assessments. At least once during every twelve (12) month period, the Company shall engage a reputable, independent, and qualified third-party auditing firm (the "Auditor") to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the Company’s technical and organizational security controls. Such assessment shall encompass, without limitation, the Company’s physical security protocols, logical access controls, network architecture, vulnerability management processes, incident response capabilities, and data encryption methodologies. The scope of the audit must cover the systems, infrastructure, and personnel involved in the processing, storage, or transmission of Customer Data.

29.3 Disclosure of Audit Reports. Upon the Customer’s written request, but no more than once per calendar year, the Company shall provide the Customer with a copy of its most recent SOC 2 Type II report, ISO certification, or a comparable executive summary of its third-party audit findings (the "Audit Results"). All Audit Results provided to the Customer shall be deemed the strictly Confidential Information of the Company and shall be subject to the non-disclosure obligations set forth in this Agreement. The Customer shall utilize the Audit Results solely for the purpose of verifying the Company’s compliance with its security obligations and shall not disclose the Audit Results to any third party, except to its professional advisors who are bound by confidentiality obligations no less restrictive than those herein, without the Company’s express prior written consent.

29.4 Customer Audit Rights. In the event that (i) the Company experiences a Security Breach (as defined elsewhere in this Agreement); (ii) a third-party audit reveals a material deficiency that the Company fails to remediate within a reasonable timeframe; or (iii) the Customer is required by a regulatory authority with jurisdiction over the Customer to conduct an independent verification of the Company's controls, the Customer shall have the right to conduct a targeted security audit. Such audit shall be performed by the Customer or an independent third-party auditor reasonably acceptable to the Company. Any Customer-initiated audit shall: (a) be conducted during the Company’s normal business hours; (b) require at least thirty (30) days’ prior written notice (except in the event of an ongoing Security Breach); (c) be performed in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the Company’s business operations; and (d) be subject to a mutually agreed-upon scope and duration. The Customer shall bear all costs associated with such audit, unless the audit reveals a material breach of the Company’s security obligations, in which case the Company shall reimburse the Customer for the reasonable, documented out-of-pocket costs of the audit.

29.5 Vulnerability Assessments and Penetration Testing. In addition to formal audits, the Company shall conduct, or commission, regular vulnerability scans and at least one (1) comprehensive manual penetration test per annum. Upon request, the Company shall provide a letter of attestation confirming the completion of such testing and the remediation of any "Critical" or "High" risk vulnerabilities identified during such assessments.

29.6 Remediation and Non-Compliance. Should any audit or assessment identify a material weakness, significant deficiency, or non-compliance with the Company’s Security Program or this Agreement, the Company shall, at its own expense, develop and implement a corrective action plan to remediate such findings. Remediation of "Critical" or "High" risk findings shall commence immediately and be completed within thirty (30) days, unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing based on the technical complexity of the fix. The Company’s failure to maintain the certifications required under Section 29.1, or its failure to remediate material security deficiencies within the prescribed timeframes, shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement, entitling the Customer to terminate the Agreement for cause without further liability.

## 33. Indemnification by Vendor (IP Infringement)

33. INDEMNIFICATION BY VENDOR (IP INFRINGEMENT)

33.1. General Indemnity. Vendor shall, at its sole cost and expense, defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Client, its parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, successors, and permitted assigns (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, actions, judgments, settlements, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs, or expenses of whatever kind, including reasonable attorneys' fees, fees and the costs of enforcing any right to indemnification hereunder, and the cost of pursuing any insurance providers (collectively, "Losses"), arising out of or resulting from any third-party claim, suit, action, or proceeding ("Claim") alleging that the Services, Deliverables, or the Client’s use thereof in accordance with this Agreement infringes, misappropriates, or otherwise violates any intellectual property rights of a third party, including but not limited to any patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, or other proprietary right.

33.2. Procedures for Indemnification. The Indemnified Party shall: (i) provide Vendor with prompt written notice of the Claim; provided, however, that any delay in notification shall not relieve Vendor of its obligations except to the extent that such delay materially prejudices Vendor’s ability to defend the Claim; (ii) grant Vendor sole control over the defense and settlement of the Claim; and (iii) provide all reasonable assistance requested by Vendor at Vendor’s expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Vendor shall not enter into any settlement that imposes any liability or obligation on the Indemnified Party, or contains an admission of fault or wrongdoing by the Indemnified Party, without the Indemnified Party’s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. The Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its own expense, to participate in the defense of any Claim with counsel of its choosing.

33.3. Mitigation and Remediation. If the Services or Deliverables, or any portion thereof, become, or in Vendor's reasonable opinion are likely to become, the subject of an infringement Claim, or if the Client’s use thereof is enjoined or threatened to be enjoined, Vendor shall, at its sole option and expense: (i) procure for the Client the right to continue using the Services or Deliverables in a manner consistent with this Agreement; (ii) replace or modify the Services or Deliverables so that they become non-infringing while remaining functionally equivalent and meeting all specifications set forth in the applicable Statement of Work; or (iii) if neither (i) nor (ii) is commercially feasible despite Vendor’s best efforts, terminate this Agreement (or the applicable Statement of Work) and refund to the Client all prepaid but unearned fees for the infringing portion of the Services or Deliverables, as well as a pro-rata refund of any fees paid for the infringing item based on a five-year straight-line depreciation schedule.

33.4. Exceptions. Vendor shall have no obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Parties under this Section 33 to the extent that the Claim arises from: (i) the Client's use of the Services or Deliverables in a manner not authorized by this Agreement or the applicable documentation; (ii) modifications to the Services or Deliverables made by any party other than Vendor or its authorized subcontractors, if the infringement would not have occurred but for such modification; (iii) the combination, operation, or use of the Services or Deliverables with any technology, software, hardware, or data not provided or authorized by Vendor, if the infringement would not have occurred but for such combination; or (iv) Vendor's compliance with specific designs, plans, or specifications provided by the Client, where the infringement is directly attributable to such designs, plans, or specifications.

33.5. Exclusivity. This Section 33 states the entire liability of Vendor and the sole and exclusive remedy of the Indemnified Parties with respect to any Claim for intellectual property infringement or misappropriation. This indemnification obligation shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement.

## 34. Indemnification by Customer

34. INDEMNIFICATION BY CUSTOMER. Customer shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Company and its parent, subsidiaries, and affiliates, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, successors, and permitted assigns (collectively, "Indemnified Parties"), from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, actions, judgments, settlements, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs, or expenses of whatever kind, including reasonable attorneys' fees, the cost of enforcing any right to indemnification under this Agreement, and the cost of pursuing any insurance providers (collectively, "Losses"), resulting from any claim, suit, action, or proceeding brought by a third party ("Third-Party Claim") arising out of or occurring in connection with: (a) Customer's breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, or obligation set forth in this Agreement; (b) any negligent or more culpable act or omission (including recklessness or willful misconduct) by Customer or any of its employees, agents, or contractors in connection with this Agreement; (c) any violation of applicable law, rule, or regulation by Customer; (d) any claim that Customer Data or Customer’s use of the Services infringes, misappropriates, or otherwise violates the intellectual property, proprietary, or privacy rights of any third party; or (e) Customer’s unauthorized or improper use of the Services or Company Intellectual Property. The Indemnified Party shall provide Customer with prompt written notice of any Third-Party Claim; provided, however, that any delay in providing such notice shall not relieve Customer of its indemnification obligations except to the extent that Customer is materially prejudiced by such delay. Customer shall have the right to assume the defense and settlement of the Third-Party Claim, provided that Customer may not settle any Third-Party Claim in a manner that admits liability on the part of the Indemnified Party or imposes any financial or performance obligation on the Indemnified Party without the Indemnified Party’s prior written consent. The Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its own expense, to participate in the defense of any Third-Party Claim with counsel of its own choosing. This Section 34 shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason.

## 35. Indemnification Procedures and Control of Defense

35. INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURES AND CONTROL OF DEFENSE

35.1 Notice of Claim. The party seeking indemnification under this Agreement (the "Indemnified Party") shall give the party from whom indemnification is sought (the "Indemnifying Party") prompt written notice of any third-party claim, demand, suit, action, or legal proceeding (each, a "Claim") for which it seeks indemnification. Such notice shall be provided as soon as reasonably practicable and shall contain a description of the Claim, the nature of the damages sought, and copies of all relevant documentation and pleadings then in the possession of the Indemnified Party. The failure of the Indemnified Party to provide prompt notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that the defense of such Claim is materially and adversely prejudiced by the delay in notification.

35.2 Assumption of Defense. Upon receipt of a notice of a Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right, exercisable by providing written notice to the Indemnified Party within fifteen (15) days of receipt, to assume and control the defense, investigation, and settlement of such Claim at its sole cost and expense. The Indemnifying Party shall select and employ reputable legal counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party to represent the interests of both parties. Following the assumption of the defense by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate in the defense of the Claim through separate counsel of its own choosing and at its own expense, provided that the Indemnifying Party shall maintain ultimate control over the strategy and conduct of the litigation.

35.3 Conditions for Defense. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 35.2, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to assume or maintain control of the defense of any Claim, and the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified Party, if: (a) the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense of the Claim within the period specified in Section 35.2; (b) the Indemnified Party reasonably determines, based on the advice of legal counsel, that a conflict of interest exists between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party that would make separate representation necessary under applicable professional standards; (c) the Claim involves criminal allegations or seeks injunctive or equitable relief against the Indemnified Party that could materially impact its business operations; or (d) the Indemnifying Party fails to diligently prosecute the defense of the Claim.

35.4 Settlement and Compromise. The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed), settle, compromise, or consent to the entry of any judgment regarding any Claim if such settlement, compromise, or judgment: (a) does not include a full, unconditional, and irrevocable release of the Indemnified Party from all liability in respect of such Claim; (b) imposes any financial obligation or liability upon the Indemnified Party for which it is not fully indemnified hereunder; (c) involves an admission of fault, guilt, or violation of law by the Indemnified Party; or (d) provides for any non-monetary or injunctive relief that would restrict the future business activities of the Indemnified Party. Conversely, the Indemnified Party shall not settle or compromise any Claim for which it seeks indemnification without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party.

35.5 Cooperation. The Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in the defense or settlement of any Claim. Such cooperation shall include, without limitation, providing the Indemnifying Party with reasonable access to the Indemnified Party’s records, documents, and personnel, making witnesses available for interviews, depositions, and testimony, and providing such other information or assistance as may be reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party for the effective defense of the Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in providing such cooperation.

35.6 Subrogation. Upon payment of any indemnification amount by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the rights of recovery of the Indemnified Party against any third party with respect to the matters to which such payment relates. The Indemnified Party shall execute and deliver such instruments and papers and take such other actions as may be reasonably required to facilitate the exercise of such subrogation rights.

## 36. Limitation of Liability: Monetary Caps

36. Limitation of Liability: Monetary Caps

36.1 Aggregate Liability. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the total, cumulative, and aggregate liability of each Party, including its respective affiliates, subsidiaries, parents, directors, officers, employees, representatives, agents, and subcontractors (collectively, the "Released Entities"), for any and all claims, demands, actions, causes of action, losses, damages, costs, expenses, and liabilities of any nature whatsoever, whether arising out of or related to this Agreement, the performance or non-performance of services, the use of any deliverables, or any breach, termination, or expiration of this Agreement, regardless of the legal or equitable theory upon which such liability is based—including, without limitation, contract, tort (including negligence, whether active, passive, or imputed), strict liability, indemnity, contribution, breach of warranty, or breach of statutory duty—shall be strictly limited to and shall not exceed, in the aggregate, an amount equal to the total fees actually paid by the Customer to the Provider under this Agreement during the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the date on which the event, act, or omission giving rise to the initial claim first occurred (the "Liability Cap").

36.2 Multiple Claims. The existence of more than one claim, or the occurrence of multiple events giving rise to liability, shall not serve to enlarge, extend, or increase the Liability Cap. The Liability Cap represents a single, maximum, and comprehensive limit applicable to the entirety of the relationship between the Parties and all transactions contemplated herein. Each Party acknowledges that this limitation applies regardless of the number of incidents or the number of parties asserting claims.

36.3 Exclusions and Exceptions. The limitations of liability set forth in Section 36.1 shall not apply to, and shall not limit, a Party’s liability for: (a) damages resulting from a Party’s gross negligence, willful misconduct, or intentional fraud; (b) liability for death or personal injury resulting directly from a Party's negligence; (c) the Customer’s underlying obligation to pay any and all undisputed fees, expenses, or other charges properly invoiced and owed under the terms of this Agreement; or (d) any other liability which, by operation of mandatory applicable law, cannot be excluded or limited by contract.

36.4 Allocation of Risk. The Parties expressly acknowledge and agree that the limitations of liability and the monetary caps specified in this Section 36 represent a fundamental and bargained-for allocation of risk between the Parties. The Parties further agree that the pricing, fees, and other consideration payable under this Agreement have been calculated and agreed upon in express reliance on these limitations. This Section 36 constitutes an essential basis of the bargain between the Parties, without which the Parties would not have entered into this Agreement.

36.5 Failure of Essential Purpose. The Parties agree that the limitations of liability and monetary caps specified in this Section 36 shall survive and remain in full force and effect even if any limited remedy specified in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose. To the extent that any jurisdiction does not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain categories of damages, the liability of the Parties shall be limited to the greatest extent permitted by the laws of such jurisdiction.

36.6 Third-Party Beneficiaries. The limitations of liability set forth in this Section 36 shall extend to and be for the benefit of the Released Entities, who shall be entitled to rely upon and enforce the provisions of this Section as third-party beneficiaries. No other person or entity shall be entitled to the benefits of the Liability Cap provided herein.

## 37. Exclusion of Consequential and Indirect Damages

37. EXCLUSION OF CONSEQUENTIAL AND INDIRECT DAMAGES. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event and under no legal theory, whether in contract, tort (including negligence, whether active, passive, or imputed), strict liability, breach of warranty, indemnity, or otherwise, shall either Party, its affiliates, subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, or licensors be liable to the other Party or any third party for any indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, punitive, or consequential damages of any character or nature whatsoever. This comprehensive exclusion includes, without limitation, damages for loss of actual or anticipated profits, loss of revenue, loss of business opportunity, loss of anticipated savings, business interruption, loss of use, loss or corruption of data, loss of goodwill, cost of procurement of substitute goods or services, or injury to reputation, arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, the performance or non-performance of obligations hereunder, or the use of or inability to use any products or services provided, regardless of whether such damages were foreseeable and even if the Party has been advised of the possibility of such damages or if such damages were within the contemplation of the Parties. The Parties expressly acknowledge and agree that the limitations and exclusions of liability set forth in this Section 37 are a fundamental basis of the bargain between the Parties, and that the consideration provided under this Agreement has been determined in reliance upon these limitations. This exclusion shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose of any limited remedy available under this Agreement. In the event that any jurisdiction does not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain categories of damages, the liability of the Parties in such jurisdiction shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by the applicable law of that jurisdiction.

## 38. Exceptions to Liability Limitations (Super Caps)

38. EXCEPTIONS TO LIABILITY LIMITATIONS (SUPER CAPS)

38.1. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained within this Agreement, including but not limited to any general limitation of liability or exclusion of consequential, incidental, or indirect damages, the limitations of liability set forth in Section 37 (Limitation of Liability) shall not apply to the categories of claims, losses, liabilities, or damages set forth in this Section 38 (collectively, the "Excluded Claims"). 

38.2. Unlimited Liability. Neither Party shall exclude or limit its liability to the other Party for: (a) death or personal injury resulting from the negligence of the defaulting Party, its employees, agents, or subcontractors; (b) fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, or willful misconduct; (c) any breach of the payment obligations arising under this Agreement; or (d) any other liability which, by governing law, cannot be excluded or limited.

38.3. Super Caps. For the following categories of liability, the general liability cap set forth in Section 37 shall be superseded and replaced by a higher aggregate limit (the "Super Cap") equivalent to five (5) times the total fees paid or payable by the Client to the Provider during the twenty-four (24) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim, or the sum of five million dollars ($5,000,000.00), whichever is greater:

(a) Indemnification Obligations. Any and all claims for which a Party is required to provide indemnification under this Agreement, including but not limited to third-party claims alleging that the services, software, or deliverables provided hereunder infringe upon the intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks, or trade secrets, of any third party.

(b) Confidentiality and Data Privacy. Any breach of Section 12 (Confidentiality) or Section 14 (Data Protection and Security), including but not limited to unauthorized access to, or the loss, theft, destruction, or disclosure of, Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Protected Health Information (PHI), or other sensitive data, regardless of whether such breach arises from negligence or a failure to maintain the technical and organizational security measures required by this Agreement or applicable law.

(c) Regulatory Fines and Penalties. Any fines, penalties, assessments, or costs imposed by a governmental or regulatory authority resulting from a Party’s non-compliance with statutory or regulatory requirements directly attributable to the performance or non-performance of its obligations under this Agreement.

(d) Gross Negligence. Any losses or damages arising out of the gross negligence of a Party, defined as a conscious and voluntary disregard of the need to use reasonable care, which is or is likely to cause foreseeable grave injury or harm to persons, property, or both.

38.4. Relation to General Cap. For the avoidance of doubt, the Super Caps established in Section 38.3 are intended to be separate and distinct from the general liability cap. Amounts paid toward satisfying claims under a Super Cap shall not erode the general liability cap, nor shall amounts paid under the general liability cap reduce the availability of the Super Cap for Excluded Claims.

38.5. Survival. The provisions of this Section 38 shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement for any reason and shall remain in full force and effect until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations for any claim arising out of or related to the subject matter herein.

## 39. Insurance Coverage Requirements

39. INSURANCE COVERAGE REQUIREMENTS

39.1 Required Coverages. Throughout the term of this Agreement and for a period of no less than three (3) years following the expiration or termination hereof, the Contractor shall, at its sole cost and expense, procure and maintain in full force and effect the following insurance policies with insurance companies authorized to do business in the jurisdiction where the Services are performed and possessing an A.M. Best’s rating of no less than A-VII:

(a) Commercial General Liability Insurance. Insurance written on an occurrence basis, including coverage for bodily injury, property damage, personal and advertising injury, and products-completed operations, with limits of liability of not less than $2,000,000 per occurrence and $4,000,000 in the annual aggregate. 

(b) Workers' Compensation and Employers' Liability Insurance. Statutory Workers' Compensation insurance as required by applicable law in the state or jurisdiction where the Services are performed, and Employers' Liability insurance with limits of not less than $1,000,000 per accident for bodily injury, $1,000,000 per employee for bodily injury by disease, and $1,000,000 policy limit for bodily injury by disease.

(c) Professional Liability (Errors and Omissions) Insurance. Professional liability insurance appropriate to the Contractor’s profession, covering financial loss resulting from error, omission, or negligent acts, with limits of not less than $5,000,000 per claim and in the aggregate. If such policy is written on a "claims-made" basis, the Contractor warrants that any retroactive date under the policy shall precede the effective date of this Agreement and that continuous coverage will be maintained or an extended discovery period will be exercised for a period of three (3) years beginning from the time that the Services under this Agreement are completed.

(d) Business Automobile Liability Insurance. Coverage for all owned, non-owned, and hired vehicles used in connection with the performance of the Services, with a combined single limit of not less than $1,000,000 per accident for bodily injury and property damage.

(f) Umbrella or Excess Liability Insurance. Coverage written on a follow-form basis in excess of the Commercial General Liability, Employers' Liability, and Automobile Liability policies described above, with a limit of not less than $5,000,000 per occurrence.

39.2 Additional Insured Status. The Contractor shall name the Client, its subsidiaries, affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents as "Additional Insureds" on the Commercial General Liability, Automobile Liability, and Umbrella/Excess Liability policies. Such insurance shall be primary and non-contributory with respect to any insurance or self-insurance maintained by the Client.

39.3 Waiver of Subrogation. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Contractor hereby waives, and shall cause its insurers to waive, all rights of subrogation against the Client and its insurers for any and all claims, losses, or damages arising out of or in connection with the performance of the Services.

39.4 Certificates of Insurance and Notice of Cancellation. Prior to the commencement of any work under this Agreement, the Contractor shall furnish the Client with certificates of insurance evidencing the coverages required herein. Each policy shall be endorsed to provide that the Client shall receive at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice in the event of cancellation, non-renewal, or material reduction in coverage. The Contractor’s failure to provide such certificates or the Client’s failure to demand them shall not constitute a waiver of the Contractor’s obligation to maintain the required insurance.

39.5 Non-Limitation of Liability. The minimum insurance requirements set forth in this Section 39 shall not be construed as a limitation of the Contractor’s liability under the indemnification provisions of this Agreement or otherwise. The Contractor shall be responsible for any deductibles or self-insured retentions contained within the required insurance policies. If the Contractor fails to maintain the required insurance, the Client may, but shall not be obligated to, purchase such insurance at the Contractor’s expense and offset the cost against any sums due to the Contractor under this Agreement.

## 40. Term, Initial Period, and Automatic Renewal

40. TERM, INITIAL PERIOD, AND AUTOMATIC RENEWAL

40.1 Initial Term. This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and, unless sooner terminated pursuant to the express termination provisions contained herein, shall remain in full force and effect for a fixed period of [Number] ([#]) [months/years] (the “Initial Term”). Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the Initial Term represents a minimum commitment and that the pricing and commercial considerations set forth in this Agreement are predicated upon the full duration of said Initial Term.

40.2 Automatic Renewal. Upon the expiration of the Initial Term, this Agreement shall automatically and without further act or instrument be renewed for successive, consecutive periods of [Number] ([#]) [months/years] each (each a “Renewal Term” and, collectively with the Initial Term, the “Term”). Such renewal shall be on the same terms and conditions as set forth in this Agreement, subject to any price adjustments or modifications executed in accordance with the provisions herein.

40.3 Notice of Non-Renewal. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 40.2, either Party may prevent the automatic renewal of this Agreement by providing the other Party with a formal, written notice of its intent not to renew (a “Notice of Non-Renewal”). To be effective, the Notice of Non-Renewal must be delivered in strict accordance with the notice requirements set forth in Section [Number] (Notices) of this Agreement at least [Number] ([#]) calendar days prior to the expiration of the then-current Initial Term or Renewal Term, as applicable. Time is of the essence with respect to the delivery of the Notice of Non-Renewal.

40.4 Failure to Provide Notice. In the event that neither Party delivers a Notice of Non-Renewal within the timeframes prescribed in Section 40.3, this Agreement shall be deemed irrevocably renewed for the subsequent Renewal Term. Neither Party shall have the right to rescind such renewal once the notice period has elapsed, and any subsequent attempt to terminate the Agreement during a Renewal Term shall be subject to the early termination penalties or obligations set forth in Section [Number] (Termination) of this Agreement.

40.5 Rate Adjustments During Renewal Terms. [Party Name] reserves the right to adjust the fees, rates, and charges applicable to any Renewal Term, provided that [Party Name] provides written notice of such adjustments to the other Party no less than [Number] ([#]) days prior to the commencement of the applicable Renewal Term. If no such notice is provided, the fees applicable during the immediately preceding Term shall continue to apply, subject to any standard inflationary adjustments otherwise permitted by this Agreement.

40.6 Survival of Obligations. The expiration or non-renewal of this Agreement shall not relieve either Party of any obligations, duties, or liabilities that accrued prior to the date of such expiration or non-renewal. Furthermore, all provisions of this Agreement which by their nature are intended to survive the expiration or termination of the Agreement—including, without limitation, provisions regarding confidentiality, indemnification, limitation of liability, governing law, and dispute resolution—shall remain in full force and effect following the conclusion of the Term.

## 41. Termination for Material Breach

41. TERMINATION FOR MATERIAL BREACH

41.1 Right of Termination. Either Party (the "Non-Breaching Party") may terminate this Agreement, in whole or in part, effective immediately upon written notice to the other Party (the "Breaching Party"), if the Breaching Party commits a Material Breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, or obligation contained within this Agreement. For the purposes of this Section 41, a "Material Breach" shall be defined as a substantial failure to afford the Non-Breaching Party the fundamental benefit of the bargain contemplated herein, or any breach of a provision that is expressly designated as material within this Agreement.

41.2 Notice and Cure Period. Except as otherwise provided in Section 41.3, the right to terminate under Section 41.1 is subject to the following condition precedent: the Non-Breaching Party must provide the Breaching Party with a formal written notice of default (the "Breach Notice") detailing the specific nature and extent of the breach. The Breaching Party shall have a period of thirty (30) calendar days from the date of receipt of the Breach Notice (the "Cure Period") to remedy such breach. If the Breaching Party fails to cure the Material Breach to the reasonable satisfaction of the Non-Breaching Party within the Cure Period, this Agreement shall terminate automatically upon the expiration of said period without further notice or action required by either Party.

41.3 Irremediable Breaches. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 41.2, the Non-Breaching Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice, without the requirement of a Cure Period, if the Material Breach is, by its nature, incapable of remedy. Irremediable breaches shall include, but are not limited to, a breach of confidentiality obligations, a violation of the other Party’s intellectual property rights, any act of fraud, gross negligence, or willful misconduct, or any breach that significantly undermines the trust and confidence essential to the continuation of the contractual relationship.

41.4 Anticipatory Breach. If either Party, through its actions or communications, clearly and unequivocally indicates an intention not to perform its material obligations hereunder when such performance becomes due, the other Party may treat such indication as an anticipatory Material Breach and exercise its rights of termination under this Section 41 immediately, without prejudice to any other rights or remedies available at law or in equity.

41.5 Cumulative Remedies. The right of either Party to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 41 shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights, remedies, or causes of action which such Party may have against the Breaching Party. Termination for Material Breach shall not affect any liability for prior breaches or any obligations which, by their nature or express terms, are intended to survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement, including but not limited to indemnification, limitation of liability, and governing law provisions.

41.6 Mitigation of Damages. Upon the occurrence of a Material Breach, the Non-Breaching Party shall take all commercially reasonable steps to mitigate any losses or damages arising therefrom, provided that such mitigation efforts shall not waive the Non-Breaching Party's right to seek full compensation for the remaining damages caused by the Breaching Party's default.

## 42. Termination for Insolvency or Bankruptcy

42. TERMINATION FOR INSOLVENCY OR BANKRUPTCY

42.1 To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, either Party (the "Terminating Party") may terminate this Agreement in its entirety, effective immediately upon the delivery of written notice to the other Party (the "Insolvent Party"), without the requirement of any judicial intervention or prior notice period, upon the occurrence of any of the following events (each an "Insolvency Event"): (a) the Insolvent Party becomes insolvent, admits in writing its inability to pay its debts as they become due, or makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors; (b) the Insolvent Party applies for, consents to, or acquiesces in the appointment of a trustee, receiver, sequestrator, liquidator, or custodian for itself or for a substantial part of its property or assets; (c) any bankruptcy, reorganization, debt arrangement, or other proceeding under any bankruptcy or insolvency law, or any dissolution or liquidation proceeding, is instituted by the Insolvent Party, or is instituted against the Insolvent Party and is not dismissed within sixty (60) calendar days; (d) the Insolvent Party takes any corporate action to authorize any of the actions set forth in this Section; (e) the Insolvent Party ceases to conduct its business operations in the normal course or threatens to cease the same; or (f) any event occurs in any jurisdiction to which the Insolvent Party is subject that has an effect equivalent or similar to any of the events specified in this Section 42.1.

42.2 In the event of a termination pursuant to this Section 42, the Insolvent Party shall, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, remain liable for all obligations and liabilities accrued prior to the effective date of termination. The Terminating Party shall be entitled to exercise any and all rights and remedies available to it at law or in equity, including, without limitation, the right to seek damages, the right to set-off any amounts owed to it by the Insolvent Party against any amounts the Terminating Party may owe to the Insolvent Party, and the right to reclaim any materials, proprietary information, or assets in the possession of the Insolvent Party.

42.3 The Parties acknowledge and agree that this Agreement is an executory contract for the provision of services and/or licenses as contemplated under Section 365 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (or any successor or equivalent provision in any relevant jurisdiction). If the Insolvent Party becomes a debtor under the Bankruptcy Code or similar insolvency legislation, and this Agreement is not terminated prior to the filing of a petition, the Insolvent Party (or its trustee) must timely assume or reject this Agreement in accordance with applicable law. In the event of an assumption, the Insolvent Party shall provide adequate assurance of future performance and cure all existing defaults as a condition precedent to such assumption.

42.4 The exercise of the right of termination under this Section 42 shall not be construed as a waiver of any other rights or remedies the Terminating Party may have under this Agreement, and such termination shall not be deemed a breach of contract by the Terminating Party. All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature are intended to survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement shall survive a termination under this Section 42.

## 43. Suspension of Services

43. SUSPENSION OF SERVICES

43.1 Right to Suspend. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company reserves the unilateral and absolute right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to suspend, interrupt, or limit the Client’s access to or use of the Services, in whole or in part, without prior notice or liability to the Client, upon the occurrence of any of the following events: (a) any material breach by the Client of its obligations under this Agreement, including but not limited to the non-payment of any fees, charges, or expenses when due; (b) the Company’s reasonable belief that the Client’s use of the Services is in violation of applicable laws, administrative regulations, or third-party rights; (c) the detection of any security threat, unauthorized access, or potential compromise to the integrity, stability, or security of the Company’s infrastructure, network, or the data of other clients; (d) compliance with any governmental, judicial, or regulatory order, subpoena, or request; or (e) the performance of emergency maintenance, critical repairs, or infrastructure upgrades necessary to preserve the operational functionality and safety of the Services.

43.2 Notice and Duration. Except in circumstances where immediate suspension is deemed necessary by the Company to mitigate imminent harm, prevent fraud, or comply with legal mandates, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Client with notice of the suspension and the underlying cause thereof. The duration of any such suspension shall be determined solely by the Company and shall continue until such time as the Company is satisfied, in its sole and absolute discretion, that the cause for the suspension has been fully remediated and any outstanding defaults or breaches have been cured to the Company's satisfaction.

43.3 Continued Obligations and Limitation of Liability. During any period of suspension, the Client shall not be relieved of its obligation to pay all applicable fees, taxes, and charges accruing under this Agreement. The Company shall not be liable to the Client or any third party for any damages, losses, liabilities, or costs (including, without limitation, loss of data, loss of profits, loss of goodwill, or business interruption) arising out of or in connection with the Company’s exercise of its rights to suspend the Services in accordance with this Section 43. The Client hereby waives and releases any and all claims, demands, or causes of action against the Company related to such suspension.

43.4 Reinstatement. Reinstatement of the Services following a suspension for cause shall be subject to a reinstatement fee, if applicable, and the Client’s execution of such further assurances as the Company may require to ensure future compliance with the terms of this Agreement. If the cause for suspension is not remedied to the Company’s satisfaction within thirty (30) calendar days of the initial suspension date, the Company may, at its option, treat such suspension as a material and incurable breach and proceed to terminate this Agreement for cause pursuant to the termination provisions herein, without further obligation to the Client.

## 44. Post-Termination Obligations and Effects

44. POST-TERMINATION OBLIGATIONS AND EFFECTS

44.1. Survival of Provisions. The expiration or termination of this Agreement, regardless of the cause or manner of such termination, shall not release either Party from any liability or obligation set forth in this Agreement which the Parties have expressly agreed shall survive any such expiration or termination or which by their nature would naturally be intended to survive such expiration or termination. Specifically, the provisions relating to Confidentiality, Intellectual Property Rights, Indemnification, Limitation of Liability, Governing Law, Dispute Resolution, and this Section 44 shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason and remain in full force and effect for the maximum period permitted by applicable law.

44.2. Cessation of Rights and Activities. Upon the effective date of termination or expiration of this Agreement:
(a) All licenses, sublicenses, and rights of use granted by either Party to the other under this Agreement shall immediately terminate, and each Party shall cease all use of the other Party’s Intellectual Property, including but not limited to trademarks, service marks, trade names, and proprietary software;
(b) The Provider shall cease the performance of all Services, except as may be required under any transition assistance obligations set forth herein or as otherwise requested in writing by the Client;
(c) Each Party shall immediately discontinue any representations that it is associated with the other Party in the capacity contemplated by this Agreement.

44.3. Return or Destruction of Proprietary Property. Within fifteen (15) business days following the termination or expiration of this Agreement, each Party shall, at the other Party’s option, either return to the other Party or securely destroy all Confidential Information, data, documentation, hardware, equipment, and other materials belonging to the other Party then in its possession, custody, or control. In the event of destruction, the destroying Party shall provide a written certification, signed by an authorized officer, confirming that all such materials have been permanently deleted or destroyed in a manner that renders them unrecoverable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party may retain one (1) copy of the other Party’s Confidential Information solely to the extent required to comply with applicable statutory or regulatory document retention requirements, provided that such retained information shall remain subject to the confidentiality obligations of this Agreement for as long as it is retained.

44.4. Payment of Outstanding Amounts. Termination or expiration of this Agreement shall not prejudice the right of either Party to recover any payments due at the time of such termination or expiration. The Client shall remain liable to pay the Provider for all Services performed and all reimbursable expenses incurred in accordance with the terms of this Agreement up to and including the effective date of termination. All such outstanding amounts shall become immediately due and payable within thirty (30) days of the issuance of a final invoice by the Provider.

44.5. Accrued Rights and Remedies. The termination or expiration of this Agreement shall be without prejudice to any other rights or remedies to which a Party may be entitled under this Agreement, at law, or in equity. Such termination shall not affect any accrued rights or liabilities of either Party nor the coming into force or the continuance in force of any provision hereof which is expressly or by implication intended to come into or continue in force on or after such termination.

44.6. Transition Assistance. Upon the termination or expiration of this Agreement, and provided the Client has paid all undisputed amounts due to the Provider, the Provider shall, for a period not to exceed ninety (90) days, provide such reasonable cooperation and assistance as the Client may reasonably request to facilitate the orderly transition of the Services to the Client or to a successor provider. Such assistance shall be provided at the Provider's then-prevailing standard hourly rates, plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, unless the termination resulted from a material breach by the Provider, in which case such assistance shall be provided at no additional cost to the Client.

44.7. Equitable Relief. The Parties acknowledge that any breach of the post-termination obligations set forth in this Section 44 may cause irreparable harm for which monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy. Accordingly, the non-breaching Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief, specific performance, and any other equitable remedies from a court of competent jurisdiction to enforce these obligations, without the necessity of posting a bond or proving actual damages.

44.8. Release of Claims. Except for those obligations that expressly survive termination as set forth in Section 44.1, and any claims arising from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of a Party, the effective termination of this Agreement shall operate as a mutual release of all further obligations under this Agreement, but shall not discharge any liability for a breach of this Agreement occurring prior to the date of termination.

## 45. Transition Services and Data Retrieval

45. TRANSITION SERVICES AND DATA RETRIEVAL

45.1 Duty to Provide Transition Services. Upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement for any reason, including but not limited to termination for cause or convenience, Contractor shall, for a period of up to one hundred eighty (180) days following the effective date of termination (the "Transition Period"), provide such assistance and cooperation as Client may reasonably request to facilitate the orderly, non-disruptive, and seamless transition of the Services to Client or to a successor service provider designated by Client (the "Transition Services"). The primary objective of the Transition Services is to ensure the continuity of Client’s business operations and to minimize any potential adverse impact or service degradation resulting from the cessation of the Services.

45.2 Scope of Transition Services. The Transition Services shall include, without limitation: (a) the continued provision of all or a subset of the Services previously performed under this Agreement; (b) the provision of technical documentation, architectural overviews, and operational protocols related to the integration and delivery of the Services; (c) the transfer of Client Data in the manner specified in Section 45.3; (d) reasonable consultation and knowledge transfer to Client’s personnel or the successor service provider regarding the functionality and maintenance of the transitioned systems; and (e) such other assistance as is reasonably necessary to permit the Client or successor service provider to assume responsibility for the Services without material interruption.

45.3 Data Retrieval and Portability. Notwithstanding any dispute between the Parties, Contractor shall, within thirty (30) days of a written request from Client (the "Data Delivery Period"), provide Client with a complete and accurate copy of all Client Data, including all metadata, logs, and derivative datasets stored within Contractor’s systems or under Contractor’s control. Such data shall be provided in a commercially standard, industry-recognized, and machine-readable format (e.g., CSV, JSON, or SQL dump) or in such other format as the Parties may mutually agree. Contractor warrants that it shall not invoke any lien, set-off, or other withholding right over Client Data during the Transition Period, regardless of any alleged breach or non-payment by Client. Contractor shall maintain the integrity and security of Client Data throughout the retrieval process until such time as the data is successfully transferred and verified by Client.

45.4 Cooperation with Successor Provider. Contractor shall cooperate in good faith with any successor service provider, provided that such successor provider executes a non-disclosure agreement reasonably acceptable to Contractor to protect Contractor’s Confidential Information. Contractor shall not be required to disclose its trade secrets or proprietary methodologies to a direct competitor, except to the extent strictly necessary to effectuate the data migration, interface mapping, and system hand-off protocols.

45.5 Compensation for Transition Services. Unless termination is the result of a material breach by Contractor, Client shall compensate Contractor for Transition Services at Contractor’s then-current standard professional services rates, provided that such rates are no less favorable than the rates charged to other similarly situated clients for equivalent services. If termination is due to Contractor’s material breach, Transition Services shall be provided at no additional cost to Client for the first ninety (90) days of the Transition Period. Client shall remain responsible for third-party pass-through costs reasonably incurred by Contractor in the performance of Transition Services, provided such costs are pre-approved in writing by Client.

45.6 Final Disposition and Deletion. Upon the conclusion of the Transition Period and following written confirmation from Client that the Data Retrieval process is complete and verified, Contractor shall, within fifteen (15) business days, permanently and securely delete or destroy all copies of Client Data remaining in its possession or control, including backup copies, using industry-standard data sanitization methods (e.g., NIST SP 800-88). Upon Client’s request, an officer of Contractor shall provide a written certification attesting to the complete and permanent destruction of such data and the cessation of all access to Client systems.

45.7 Survival. The obligations set forth in this Section 45 shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect until the completion of all Transition Services and the final certified destruction of Client Data as mandated herein. Any breach of this Section shall be deemed a material breach, and Client shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief to enforce its rights to data retrieval and business continuity.

Each Party represents that it has not, and covenants that it will not, directly or indirectly, offer, pay, promise to pay, or authorize the payment of any money, or offer, give, promise to give, or authorize the giving of anything of value to any "Foreign Official" (as defined in the FCPA) or any other person while knowing that all or a portion of such money or thing of value will be offered, given, or promised, directly or indirectly, to any person for the purpose of influencing any act or decision in their official capacity or securing any improper advantage.

46.6 Cooperation and Disclosure.

## 49. Dispute Resolution, Mediation, and Arbitration

49. DISPUTE RESOLUTION, MEDIATION, AND ARBITRATION

49.1. Pre-Arbitration Negotiation. In the event of any controversy, claim, or dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, its interpretation, performance, breach, termination, or validity (collectively, a "Dispute"), the parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute through direct informal negotiations. Either party may initiate such negotiations by providing written notice to the other party, specifically identifying the nature of the Dispute. The parties shall meet (virtually or in person) within fourteen (14) calendar days of such notice to attempt a resolution.

49.2. Mandatory Mediation. If the Dispute is not resolved through informal negotiations within thirty (30) calendar days of the initial notice, the parties agree that, as a condition precedent to initiating arbitration or any permitted legal proceeding, they shall submit the Dispute to non-binding mediation. The mediation shall be conducted in accordance with the then-current Commercial Mediation Procedures of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) or another mutually agreed-upon alternative dispute resolution (ADR) provider. The parties shall share the mediator's fees and any filing fees equally, provided that each party shall bear its own legal fees and costs associated with the mediation. The mediation shall take place in the jurisdiction designated in Section 49.8, unless otherwise agreed in writing.

49.3. Binding Arbitration. Any Dispute that remains unresolved sixty (60) calendar days after the commencement of mediation shall be settled by final and binding arbitration administered by the AAA in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules and, where applicable, the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator appointed in accordance with said rules. The arbitrator shall be a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice in the governing jurisdiction with at least fifteen (15) years of experience in commercial contract law.

49.4. Jurisdiction and Venue. The seat and venue of the arbitration shall be in the county and state of the Company’s principal place of business, unless otherwise prohibited by mandatory local law. The proceedings shall be conducted in the English language. The arbitrator's award shall be in writing and shall include a statement of the essential findings and conclusions upon which the award is based. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction thereof.

49.5. Class Action and Jury Trial Waiver. THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT ANY PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE OR LITIGATE ANY DISPUTE WILL BE CONDUCTED SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. NEITHER PARTY SHALL SEEK TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD AS A CLASS ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION. NO ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE COMBINED WITH ANOTHER WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES TO ALL AFFECTED ARBITRATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS. THE PARTIES FURTHER IRREVOCABLY WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY JUDICIAL PROCEEDING INVOLVING ANY DISPUTE ARISING UNDER OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT.

49.6. Equitable and Injunctive Relief. Notwithstanding the agreement to arbitrate, either party may seek emergency injunctive or equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to protect its intellectual property rights, confidential information, or to maintain the status quo pending the appointment of an arbitrator. The seeking of such relief shall not be deemed a waiver of the obligation to arbitrate the underlying Dispute.

49.7. Costs and Fees. The prevailing party in any arbitration or permitted legal action arising out of this Agreement shall be entitled to recover from the non-prevailing party all reasonable costs and expenses incurred, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees, expert witness fees, and administrative costs of the arbitration.

49.8. Governing Law. This Section 49 and all Disputes shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State [Insert Jurisdiction], without regard to its conflict of law principles, and where applicable, the Federal Arbitration Act.

49.9. Severability of Dispute Provisions. If any portion of this Section 49 is found to be unenforceable or illegal, such portion shall be severed, and the remainder of this Section shall be given full force and effect. However, if the Class Action Waiver in Section 49.5 is found to be unenforceable, the entirety of Section 49.3 (Binding Arbitration) shall be rendered null and void, and any remaining Dispute shall be resolved in a court of competent jurisdiction.

50.1 Definition of Force Majeure Event. For the purposes of this Agreement, a “Force Majeure Event” shall mean any act, event, omission, or circumstance beyond the reasonable control of the party affected (the “Affected Party”), which by its nature could not have been foreseen by such party, or, if it could have been foreseen, was unavoidable, provided that the Force Majeure Event is not the result of the Affected Party’s fault or negligence. Force Majeure Events shall include, but are not limited to: (a) acts of God, lightning, fire, flood, storm, earthquake, or other natural disasters; (b) war, hostilities (whether war be declared or not), invasion, act of foreign enemies, mobilization, requisition, or embargo; (c) rebellion, revolution, insurrection, military or usurped power, or civil war; (d) riot, commotion, strikes, go-slows, lockouts, or industrial disputes (whether involving the workforce of the Affected Party or any other party); (e) acts of terrorism, sabotage, or piracy; (f) epidemic, pandemic, or other public health emergencies, including related government-mandated lockdowns, quarantines, or travel restrictions; (g) any law or any action taken by a government or public authority, including without limitation imposing an export or import restriction, quota, or prohibition, or failing to grant a necessary license or consent; and (h) the prolonged breakdown of transport, telecommunications, or public utility services.

Subject to the fulfillment of the conditions set forth in this Section 50, neither party shall be deemed to be in breach of this Agreement or otherwise liable to the other party for any delay in performance or non-performance of its obligations hereunder to the extent that such delay or non-performance is due to a Force Majeure Event. In such circumstances, the time for performance shall be extended by a period equivalent to the period during which performance of the obligation has been delayed or prevented.

50.3 Notice Requirements. The Affected Party shall, as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event within seven (7) business days of the commencement of the Force Majeure Event, notify the other party in writing of the nature and extent of the Force Majeure Event, the estimated duration of the delay, and the specific obligations affected. The Affected Party shall provide further periodic reports as the other party may reasonably request regarding the status of the event and the Affected Party’s efforts to resume performance.

50.4 Duty to Mitigate. The Affected Party shall use all commercially reasonable endeavors to mitigate the effect of the Force Majeure Event on the performance of its obligations, including the implementation of any disaster recovery or business continuity plans. The Affected Party shall resume the performance of its obligations as soon as reasonably possible after the cessation or abatement of the Force Majeure Event.

50.5 Exclusions. Notwithstanding the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, the provisions of this Section 50 shall not: (a) excuse, delay, or otherwise affect the obligation of either party to make any payment of money due and owing to the other party under this Agreement; (b) apply to any failure of a party to perform where such failure is caused by the negligence, willful misconduct, or lack of financial resources of such party; or (c) excuse any obligations related to confidentiality, non-disclosure, or intellectual property rights.

50.6 Termination for Prolonged Force Majeure. If the Force Majeure Event continues for a continuous period of more than ninety (90) calendar days, either party may terminate this Agreement by giving thirty (30) days' written notice to the other party. Such termination shall be without prejudice to the rights of the parties in respect of any breach of this Agreement occurring prior to such Force Majeure Event or any obligations that survived the termination of this Agreement. Each party shall bear its own costs arising from the Force Majeure Event and the subsequent termination of the Agreement under this clause.

## 51. Assignment and Change of Control

51. Assignment and Change of Control.

(a) General Prohibition. Neither party may assign, delegate, pledge, encumber, or otherwise transfer this Agreement, or any of its rights, interests, duties, or obligations hereunder, whether by operation of law, merger, reorganization, or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. Any attempted assignment, delegation, or transfer in contravention of this Section 51 shall be deemed null, void ab initio, and of no force or effect, and shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement entitling the non-assigning party to immediate termination rights.

(b) Permitted Assignments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may, upon ten (10) business days’ prior written notice to the other party, assign this Agreement in its entirety without the requirement of obtaining such other party’s prior written consent to: (i) an Affiliate of the assigning party, provided that the assignor remains solidarily liable with the Affiliate for the full performance of all obligations and the satisfaction of all liabilities under this Agreement; or (ii) a successor-in-interest in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of the assets or voting securities of the assigning party to which this Agreement relates; provided, however, that in each case (x) the assignee or successor expressly assumes in writing all of the obligations and liabilities of the assignor under this Agreement, (y) the assignee possesses the financial and operational standing necessary to fulfill the terms of this Agreement, and (z) the assignee is not a direct competitor of the non-assigning party as determined in the non-assigning party’s reasonable discretion.

(c) Change of Control. For the purposes of this Agreement, a "Change of Control" shall be deemed an assignment requiring consent under subsection (a) and shall be defined as: (i) the consummation of a reorganization, merger, or consolidation, or sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of a party; or (ii) the acquisition by any individual, entity, or group of beneficial ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of either the then-outstanding shares of common stock or the combined voting power of the then-outstanding voting securities of a party entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. Any party undergoing a Change of Control shall provide the other party with prompt written notice of such event no later than thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of the transaction, unless prohibited by applicable securities laws or confidentiality obligations, in which case notice shall be provided immediately upon the lifting of such restrictions.

(d) Assumption of Obligations and Costs. Every permitted assignment shall be evidenced by a written instrument in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the non-assigning party, pursuant to which the assignee agrees to be bound by all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. All reasonable legal and administrative costs incurred by the non-assigning party in connection with the review and processing of any request for assignment or Change of Control notice shall be borne exclusively by the party requesting such assignment or undergoing such Change of Control.

(e) Binding Effect. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and shall inure to the benefit of, the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and permitted assigns. No assignment or delegation shall relieve the assigning or delegating party of any of its obligations or liabilities accrued under this Agreement prior to the effective date of such assignment or delegation, and such party shall remain liable for the performance of all such obligations following the assignment unless a formal written release is executed by the non-assigning party.

## 55. Entire Agreement, Amendments, and Severability

55. ENTIRE AGREEMENT, AMENDMENTS, AND SEVERABILITY

55.1 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with any and all exhibits, schedules, appendices, and other documents expressly incorporated herein by reference, constitutes the sole, final, and entire agreement of the Parties with respect to the subject matter contained herein, and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, proposals, term sheets, letters of intent, representations, and warranties, whether written or oral, regarding such subject matter. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that in entering into this Agreement, it has not relied upon, and shall have no remedy in respect of, any statement, representation, warranty, collateral contract, or other assurance (whether made negligently or innocently) of any person (whether a party to this Agreement or not) other than those expressly set forth in this Agreement.

55.2 Amendments and Modifications. No amendment, modification, supplement, rescission, or termination of this Agreement shall be effective or binding upon the Parties unless it is in writing, specifically references this Agreement, and is executed by a duly authorized representative of each Party. No course of dealing, usage of trade, or course of performance shall be used to supplement, explain, or modify any term or condition of this Agreement. Any purported oral amendment or modification shall be deemed null and void and of no legal force or effect.

55.3 Waivers. No waiver by any Party of any of the provisions hereof shall be effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and signed by the Party so waiving. No waiver of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach or default of the same or similar nature. No failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, remedy, power, or privilege arising from this Agreement shall operate or be construed as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power, or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power, or privilege.

55.4 Severability. If any term, covenant, condition, or provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any person or circumstance, shall at any time or to any extent be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, void, or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, covenants, conditions, and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired, or invalidated thereby. It is the express intent of the Parties that if any court of competent jurisdiction determines that any portion of this Agreement is unenforceable as written, such court shall have the power to reform or "blue pencil" the provision by reducing its scope, duration, or geographic area, or by deleting specific words or phrases, such that the provision shall be enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. In the event such reformation is not possible, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to replace the invalid or unenforceable provision with a valid and enforceable provision that, to the greatest extent possible, achieves the original commercial, economic, and legal objectives of the Parties as intended at the time of execution.
