## 2. Structure of Agreement and Ordering

2. STRUCTURE OF AGREEMENT AND ORDERING

2.1 Framework Agreement. This Agreement serves as a master framework governing the overall legal relationship between the Parties. The specific details, commercial terms, and technical specifications for the Services, Deliverables, or Software to be provided by Provider shall be set forth in one or more sequentially numbered or dated ordering instruments, which may be designated as an "Order Form," "Statement of Work," "SOW," or "Service Description" (each, an "Ordering Document"). This Agreement does not, of itself, represent a commitment by Customer to purchase any minimum volume of Services, nor does it obligate Provider to perform any specific task until an Ordering Document has been duly executed by authorized representatives of both Parties.

2.2 Incorporation and Separate Contracts. Each Ordering Document executed under this Agreement shall be deemed to incorporate by reference all the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Unless otherwise expressly provided in the Ordering Document, each such document shall constitute a separate and independent contractual obligation between the Parties. Any additional, different, or conflicting terms contained in any Customer-initiated purchase order, procurement portal, or other administrative document issued by Customer are hereby expressly rejected and shall have no contractual force or effect, regardless of whether Provider signs such document or accepts payment thereunder.

2.3 Order of Precedence. In the event of any conflict, ambiguity, or inconsistency between the provisions of this Agreement and any Ordering Document, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail and control, except solely to the extent that an Ordering Document expressly states the intent of the Parties to deviate from a specific provision of this Agreement by explicitly referencing the Section number of this Agreement to be superseded. Any such deviation shall be effective only for the specific Ordering Document in which it is contained and shall not be deemed a global amendment to this Agreement.

2.4 Affiliate Ordering. The Parties agree that an Affiliate of Customer may enter into Ordering Documents directly with Provider or a Provider Affiliate. In such instances, the Affiliate shall be deemed the "Customer" for the purposes of that specific Ordering Document and shall be bound by all obligations, limitations, and covenants set forth in this Agreement. Customer shall remain jointly and severally liable for the acts and omissions of its Affiliates, including but not limited to any payment obligations or breaches of confidentiality, unless the Ordering Document specifically releases Customer from such liability in writing.

2.5 Modification and Cancellation of Orders. Once fully executed, an Ordering Document may not be modified, amended, or terminated except by a written Change Order or amendment signed by authorized representatives of both Parties. Any unilateral attempt by Customer to cancel an Ordering Document prior to its natural expiration or the completion of the Services shall entitle Provider to any applicable early termination fees or liquidated damages as specified in the relevant Ordering Document or, if not specified, to the full value of the fees due for the remainder of the then-current term.

2.6 Execution. Ordering Documents may be executed in counterparts and delivered via electronic signature or PDF, each of which shall be deemed an original and together shall constitute one and the same instrument. The Parties waive any right to contest the validity or enforceability of an Ordering Document based on the form of execution or delivery.

## 3. Grant of Access and SaaS License

3.1 Grant of License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Customer’s timely payment of all applicable fees, the Provider hereby grants to the Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, and revocable right and license during the Term to access and use the Software-as-a-Service platform (the "SaaS Platform") solely for the Customer’s internal business purposes. This license is restricted to use by the specific number of Authorized Users identified in the applicable Order Form and is subject to any usage limitations, including but not limited to data storage limits or transaction volumes, set forth therein.

3.2 Authorized Users and Security. The Customer shall be responsible for all acts and omissions of its Authorized Users and any other person who gains access to the SaaS Platform through the Customer’s credentials. The Customer shall ensure that each Authorized User maintains the absolute confidentiality of their unique access credentials and shall implement industry-standard security measures to prevent unauthorized access to the SaaS Platform. The Customer shall notify the Provider immediately upon becoming aware of any unauthorized access, use, or suspected security breach.

3.3 Prohibited Conduct and Restrictions. Except as expressly permitted herein, the Customer shall not, and shall not permit any third party to: (a) copy, modify, translate, adapt, or create derivative works of the SaaS Platform; (b) rent, lease, lend, sell, sublicense, assign, distribute, publish, or otherwise transfer the SaaS Platform or any rights therein to any third party; (c) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, decode, or otherwise attempt to derive or determine the source code, underlying ideas, algorithms, or structure of the SaaS Platform; (d) bypass or breach any security device, firewall, or protection used by the SaaS Platform; (e) use the SaaS Platform in any manner that violates applicable local, state, federal, or international law or regulation; (f) remove, delete, alter, or obscure any trademarks, documentation, or copyright notices from the SaaS Platform; or (g) access the SaaS Platform for purposes of competitive analysis, benchmarking, or the development of a competing software product or service.

3.4 Proprietary Rights and Reservation of Rights. The Provider and its licensors retain all right, title, and interest, including all intellectual property rights, in and to the SaaS Platform, any related documentation, and any developments, enhancements, or modifications made thereto. No title to or ownership of the SaaS Platform or any intellectual property rights therein is transferred to the Customer under this Agreement. All rights not expressly granted to the Customer are reserved by the Provider. The Customer shall not acquire any ownership interest in the SaaS Platform under this Agreement.

3.5 Updates and Maintenance. The Provider may, from time to time in its sole discretion, perform maintenance, updates, or upgrades to the SaaS Platform. While the Provider will endeavor to provide reasonable notice of scheduled downtime and to minimize disruption, the Customer acknowledges that such activities may result in temporary unavailability. The Provider reserves the right to modify the features and functionality of the SaaS Platform, provided that such modifications do not materially degrade the core functionality of the service as of the Effective Date.

3.6 Feedback License. If the Customer or its Authorized Users provide any suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations, or other feedback relating to the SaaS Platform ("Feedback"), the Customer hereby grants the Provider a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid-up, sublicensable license to use, reproduce, modify, and incorporate such Feedback into its products and services for any purpose without any obligation of attribution, confidentiality, or compensation to the Customer.

4.3 Monitoring, Enforcement, and Termination. Company maintains the absolute right, though not the obligation, to monitor all use of the Services to ensure compliance with this Section 4. Company reserves the right to: (a) take any affirmative action it deems necessary or appropriate if the Company believes that User’s use of the Services violates the terms of this Section, infringes any intellectual property right or other right of any person or entity, threatens the personal safety of users of the Services or the public, or could create liability for the Company; (b) disclose User’s identity or other information about User to any third party who claims that material posted by User violates their rights, including their intellectual property rights or their right to privacy; (c) take appropriate legal action, including without limitation, referral to law enforcement, for any illegal or unauthorized use of the Services; and (d) terminate or suspend User’s access to all or part of the Services for any or no reason, including without limitation, any violation of these restrictions.

## 5. Authorized Users and Account Security

5. AUTHORIZED USERS AND ACCOUNT SECURITY

5.1. Registration and Eligibility. To access the Services, Customer and its designated personnel must register for an account and provide certain registration details or other information. It is a condition of use that all information provided by Customer is accurate, current, and complete. Customer represents and warrants that it has the legal capacity and authority to enter into this Agreement and that its use of the Services does not violate any applicable law or regulation. Provider reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to refuse registration or cancel any account that is found to contain inaccurate, fraudulent, or obsolete information.

5.2. Authorized Users. Access to and use of the Services is strictly limited to Customer and those specific employees, consultants, contractors, or agents expressly authorized by Customer to access the Services on its behalf (each, an “Authorized User”). Customer shall ensure that the number of Authorized Users does not exceed the maximum number permitted under the applicable Order Form. Customer shall be responsible for ensuring that all Authorized Users are notified of and comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including all use restrictions and security protocols.

5.3. Account Credentials and Confidentiality. Customer and its Authorized Users are responsible for maintaining the absolute confidentiality of all account credentials, including usernames, passwords, API keys, and any other access tokens or authentication identifiers (collectively, “Credentials”). Credentials are granted for individual use only and may not be shared, pooled, or transferred between multiple individuals or entities. Customer shall implement and enforce rigorous administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect Credentials from unauthorized disclosure or misappropriation. Any failure to safeguard Credentials shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement.

5.4. Responsibility for Account Activity. Customer assumes full and exclusive liability for all actions, transactions, data transmissions, and omissions occurring under its account and the accounts of its Authorized Users, whether such actions were authorized by Customer or not. Provider shall not be liable for any loss, damage, or unauthorized data exfiltration resulting from Customer’s failure to secure its account or Credentials. Customer hereby indemnifies and holds Provider harmless from any third-party claims arising out of or related to the use of Customer’s Credentials by any person or entity other than the designated Authorized User.

5.5. Notification of Security Incidents. Customer shall immediately, and in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours after discovery, notify Provider in writing of any actual or suspected unauthorized access to its account, compromise of Credentials, or any other breach of security related to the Services. Upon such notification, Customer shall provide all reasonable assistance to Provider to investigate the incident and shall take all necessary remedial actions requested by Provider to mitigate the impact of the breach and prevent its recurrence.

5.6. De-provisioning and Access Revocation. Customer is solely responsible for the timely de-provisioning of Authorized Users. Upon the termination of employment, end of a contractual engagement, or change in job responsibilities of any Authorized User, Customer must immediately revoke that individual’s access to the Services and invalidate their Credentials. Provider shall not be responsible for any unauthorized access or data modification resulting from Customer’s failure to promptly decommission accounts for former personnel or unauthorized agents.

5.7. Verification and Auditing. Provider reserves the right to monitor and audit Customer’s use of the Services to ensure compliance with this Section 5. If such monitoring reveals that Customer has shared Credentials or exceeded the permitted number of Authorized Users, Provider may, without limiting its other legal or equitable remedies, (i) disable the offending accounts, (ii) charge Customer for the additional usage at Provider’s then-current list price, and/or (iii) suspend Customer’s access to the Services until the non-compliance is cured to Provider’s satisfaction.

## 6. Provision of Services and Service Levels

6. PROVISION OF SERVICES AND SERVICE LEVELS

6.1 Performance Standards and Scope of Services. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the timely payment of all applicable Fees, the Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Services in a professional and workmanlike manner, consistent with generally recognized industry standards and the specifications set forth in the applicable Statement of Work or Service Order. The Provider shall maintain the requisite personnel, expertise, and infrastructure necessary to perform the Services as described herein. The Provider reserves the right to determine the methods, means, and personnel by which the Services are performed, provided that such performance complies with the requirements of this Agreement.

6.2 Service Availability and Uptime. The Provider shall endeavor to maintain the availability of the Services in accordance with the uptime targets specified in the Service Level Schedule (the "SLA") attached hereto. Except as otherwise provided in the SLA, the Provider targets a monthly uptime percentage of 99.9%, calculated on a twenty-four (24) hour per day, seven (7) day per week basis, excluding Downtime resulting from: (a) Scheduled Maintenance as defined in Section 6.3; (b) Emergency Maintenance; (c) Force Majeure Events; (d) failures or fluctuations in electrical power, telecommunications, or internet service provider networks external to the Provider’s data centers; (e) any act or omission of the Client, its employees, agents, or third-party contractors; or (f) Client’s use of the Services in a manner not authorized by this Agreement or the Documentation.

6.3 Maintenance Windows. The Provider shall be entitled to perform periodic "Scheduled Maintenance" for the purposes of system updates, hardware replacement, and infrastructure optimization. The Provider shall utilize commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Client with at least forty-eight (48) hours’ prior notice of any Scheduled Maintenance that is expected to result in Service interruption. Scheduled Maintenance shall, to the extent practicable, be conducted during periods of low usage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Provider may perform "Emergency Maintenance" at any time if the Provider reasonably determines that such maintenance is necessary to preserve the integrity, security, or availability of the Services or the Provider’s infrastructure. The Provider shall provide notice of Emergency Maintenance as soon as is reasonably practicable under the circumstances.

6.4 Service Credits and Exclusive Remedy. In the event the Provider fails to meet the Service Levels prescribed in the SLA, the Client’s sole and exclusive remedy, and the Provider’s entire liability for such failure, shall be the issuance of Service Credits as calculated and applied in accordance with the SLA. To receive a Service Credit, the Client must submit a written request to the Provider within thirty (30) days of the end of the month in which the Service Level failure occurred. Service Credits are non-refundable, have no cash value, and may only be applied against future invoices for the specific Service that failed to meet the Service Level. In no event shall the total amount of Service Credits issued in any single calendar month exceed twenty percent (20%) of the monthly recurring Fees for the affected Service.

6.5 Monitoring and Reporting. The Provider shall implement and maintain industry-standard monitoring tools to track the performance and availability of the Services. The Provider’s internal monitoring logs and data shall be the definitive record for the purpose of calculating Uptime and determining eligibility for Service Credits. Upon the Client’s reasonable written request, the Provider shall provide a summary report of Service Level performance for the preceding billing period.

6.6 Service Modifications and Evolution. The Provider reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to modify, update, enhance, or upgrade the Services (including the underlying software, infrastructure, and user interface) at any time. The Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that such modifications do not materially degrade the core functionality of the Services as utilized by the Client at the time of the modification. In the event a modification is expected to have a material adverse impact on the Client’s operations, the Provider shall provide reasonable advance notice of such change.

6.7 Client Cooperation and Dependencies. The Client acknowledges that the Provider’s ability to deliver the Services and meet the specified Service Levels is strictly contingent upon the Client’s timely cooperation and fulfillment of its obligations, including but not limited to: (a) providing accurate and complete configuration data; (b) maintaining compatible hardware and network environments; (c) ensuring adequate bandwidth; and (d) granting the Provider necessary access to Client systems as required for implementation or troubleshooting. The Provider shall be excused from any failure to meet Service Levels to the extent such failure is caused by a delay or default of the Client or a third party acting on behalf of the Client.

## 7. Maintenance, Updates, and Upgrades

7. MAINTENANCE, UPDATES, AND UPGRADES

7.1 General Maintenance Obligations. During the Term of this Agreement, the Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide maintenance services intended to ensure the Software operates in material Peck conformance with the provided Documentation. Maintenance services shall include the identification and resolution of software bugs, errors, or malfunctions (collectively, "Defects") reported by the Client or discovered by the Provider. The Provider shall prioritize the resolution of Defects based on their severity and impact on the Client’s business operations, as determined in the Provider’s sole but reasonable discretion.

7.2 Scheduled Maintenance and Service Downtime. The Provider reserves the right to temporarily suspend access to the Software to perform scheduled maintenance, including but not limited to database optimizations, server hardware repairs, and software environment configurations. The Provider shall endeavor to provide the Client with no less than forty-eight (48) hours' prior notice of any scheduled maintenance that is expected to result in service downtime. Such maintenance shall, to the extent practicable, be conducted during off-peak hours. Any period of unavailability resulting from scheduled maintenance shall not be considered a breach of any service level agreement or warranty provided herein.

7.3 Emergency Maintenance. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 7.2, the Provider may perform unscheduled emergency maintenance at any time and without prior notice if the Provider determines, in its sole discretion, that such maintenance is necessary to prevent or remediate a security threat, stabilize the Hosted Environment, or address a critical system failure. The Provider shall not be liable for any damages, losses, or claims arising from service interruptions necessitated by emergency maintenance.

7.4 Updates and Performance Enhancements. From time to time, the Provider may develop and deploy "Updates," which shall mean any patches, minor bug fixes, security enhancements, or routine performance improvements that are generally made available to the Provider’s client base at no additional charge. Given the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) nature of the delivery model, the Client acknowledges and agrees that Updates may be applied automatically by the Provider without the Client’s prior consent or intervention. The Provider reserves the right to modify, remove, or replace specific features or functionalities of the Software as part of an Update, provided that such modification does not result in a material degradation of the core functionality of the Software as described in the Documentation.

7.5 Upgrades and New Versions. "Upgrades" shall refer to significant new releases of the Software that incorporate major new features, substantial functional improvements, or a change in the underlying architecture. Unless expressly stated otherwise in an applicable Service Order or Statement of Work, Upgrades are not included in the standard Maintenance services or subscription fees. The Provider may, at its option, offer Upgrades to the Client subject to the payment of additional licensing fees and the execution of a supplemental agreement. The Provider is under no obligation to develop or release any specific Upgrades or new versions of the Software during the Term.

7.6 Version Support and End-of-Life Policy. The Provider’s obligation to provide maintenance and technical support is limited to the current version and the immediately preceding major version of the Software. The Provider reserves the right to discontinue support for older versions of the Software (the "End-of-Life" process) upon providing the Client with at least six (6) months' prior written notice. Following the effective date of an End-of-Life notice, the Provider shall be released from all obligations to provide maintenance, security patches, or technical assistance for the deprecated version.

7.7 Client Cooperation and Compatibility. The Client is responsible for ensuring that its internal hardware, operating systems, network infrastructure, and third-party web browsers meet the minimum technical specifications set forth in the Documentation. The Provider shall not be responsible for any performance degradation or software failure resulting from the Client’s use of unsupported environments or the Client’s failure to implement recommended configuration changes. Furthermore, the Client shall provide the Provider with such information and assistance as may be reasonably required to diagnose and resolve reported Defects.

7.8 Data Integrity during Maintenance. While the Provider shall employ industry-standard protocols to protect the integrity of Client Data during maintenance and update cycles, the Client is advised to maintain its own independent backups of critical data to the extent the Software’s export functionalities permit. Except in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct by the Provider, the Provider shall not be liable for any data loss or corruption occurring during the deployment of Updates or Upgrades.

## 8. Professional Services and Statements of Work

8. Professional Services and Statements of Work.

8.1 Scope of Services. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Provider shall provide to Client certain professional services, including but not limited to implementation, configuration, integration, training, or consulting services (collectively, "Professional Services") as may be detailed in a mutually executed Statement of Work (“SOW”) or an Order Form. Each SOW shall describe the specific Professional Services to be performed, the anticipated project schedule, the applicable deliverables (“Deliverables”), and the associated fees and payment milestones. Each SOW is incorporated herein by reference and shall be governed by the terms of this Agreement. In the event of a direct conflict between the terms of this Agreement and any SOW, the terms of this Agreement shall control unless the SOW expressly identifies the specific provision of the Agreement it intends to supersede.

8.2 Execution of Statements of Work. No Professional Services shall be performed, and no obligation shall arise on the part of the Provider, until an SOW has been fully executed by authorized representatives of both Parties. Each SOW represents a separate and independent contractual obligation from any other SOW.

8.3 Change Control Procedures. Either Party may request changes to the scope of the Professional Services defined in an SOW. No such change shall be effective unless and until documented in a written change order (a “Change Order”) signed by authorized representatives of both Parties. Provider shall have no obligation to commence work on any requested change until a Change Order is executed. Client acknowledges that any Change Order may impact the project timeline, resource allocation, and the total fees due under the applicable SOW.

8.4 Performance of Services and Personnel. Provider shall perform the Professional Services in a professional and workmanlike manner consistent with prevailing industry standards. Provider maintains sole and exclusive discretion regarding the assignment, management, and substitution of its personnel or permitted subcontractors. Provider shall act as an independent contractor, and nothing in this Section 8 or any SOW shall be construed to create a partnership, joint venture, or employer-employee relationship between the Parties.

8.5 Client Obligations and Cooperation. The timely and successful performance of the Professional Services is contingent upon Client’s full and timely cooperation. Client shall: (a) provide Provider with access to such facilities, equipment, software, data, and information as may be reasonably required; (b) designate a project manager with the authority to make decisions and provide approvals; and (c) ensure that Client personnel possess the necessary technical skills and knowledge to support the project. Provider shall not be liable for any delays or deficiencies in the Professional Services to the extent caused by Client’s failure to fulfill its obligations or provide required dependencies.

8.6 Acceptance of Deliverables. Upon delivery of any specific Deliverable identified in an SOW, Client shall have a period of five (5) business days, or such other period as specified in the SOW (the “Review Period”), to evaluate the Deliverable for material compliance with the specifications set forth in the SOW. If the Deliverable fails to conform in any material respect, Client must provide Provider with a detailed written description of the non-conformity prior to the expiration of the Review Period. Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to remediate the non-conformity and redeliver the Deliverable for further review. A Deliverable shall be deemed accepted if: (i) Client provides written notice of acceptance; (ii) Client fails to provide a notice of non-conformity within the Review Period; or (iii) Client uses the Deliverable in a live production environment or for any commercial purpose.

8.7 Intellectual Property Rights.
(a) Provider Materials. Provider and its licensors retain all right, title, and interest in and to all pre-existing software, tools, methodologies, templates, architectures, and intellectual property owned or licensed by Provider prior to or independent of the Professional Services (“Provider Materials”).
(b) Deliverables. Subject to the full and final payment of all fees due under the applicable SOW, Provider grants to Client a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, worldwide license to use the Deliverables solely for Client’s internal business operations in connection with Client’s authorized use of the Provider’s proprietary software platform.
(c) Residual Rights. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Provider shall be free to use its general knowledge, skills, experience, and any ideas, concepts, know-how, or techniques that are acquired or used in the course of providing the Professional Services, provided that Provider does not use or disclose Client’s Confidential Information.

8.8 Expenses. Unless otherwise specified in the SOW, Client shall reimburse Provider for all reasonable, pre-approved out-of-pocket travel and living expenses incurred by Provider’s personnel in the performance of the Professional Services, subject to Provider’s standard travel and expense policy.

8.9 Termination of SOW. Unless otherwise stated in an SOW, either Party may terminate an SOW for convenience upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice. In the event of termination of an SOW, Client shall pay Provider for all Professional Services performed, all milestones achieved, and all non-cancelable expenses incurred through the effective date of termination. Termination of an individual SOW shall not result in the termination of this Agreement or any other SOW then in effect.

Unless otherwise expressly specified in an applicable Statement of Work, the Customer shall be responsible for obtaining, maintaining, and securing all hardware, software, network connectivity, and telecommunications services necessary to access and utilize the Services. The Customer shall ensure that its systems meet the minimum technical specifications and compatibility requirements communicated by the Provider. The Provider shall not be liable for any service interruptions, performance degradation, or security vulnerabilities arising from the Customer’s failure to maintain its own technical infrastructure or to implement required updates and patches.

9.4 Consents and Regulatory Compliance. The Customer shall be responsible for obtaining and maintaining all necessary licenses, permits, consents, and permissions required for the Provider to perform the Services, including but not limited to the right to process any third-party data or use third-party proprietary software provided by the Customer.

The Provider shall not be deemed in breach of this Agreement, nor shall it be liable for any failure, deficiency, or delay in the Services, to the extent such failure, deficiency, or delay is caused by the Customer’s act, omission, or failure to perform its obligations or provide necessary cooperation. In the event of such a delay, any agreed-upon timelines or milestones shall be extended by a period of time equal to the duration of the Customer’s non-performance, and the Provider reserves the right to charge the Customer for additional costs, expenses, or idle time incurred as a result thereof.

## 10. Third-Party Integrations and Non-Provider Applications

10. Third-Party Integrations and Non-Provider Applications

10.1 Scope and Nature of Third-Party Services. The Services may contain features, functionalities, or interoperability components designed to integrate with products, services, software, applications, or websites provided by third parties, including but not limited to platforms, application programming interfaces (APIs), plugins, or extensions (collectively, "Non-Provider Applications"). Such Non-Provider Applications are not under the control, ownership, or management of the Provider. The provision of such integrations, or the inclusion of links to third-party sites or services, is for convenience only and does not constitute an endorsement, representation, or warranty by the Provider regarding the suitability, reliability, security, or quality of such third-party offerings.

10.2 Separate Agreements and Compliance. Access to and use of any Non-Provider Application is governed solely by the terms and conditions of a separate agreement between the Customer and the applicable third-party provider. The Provider is not a party to such agreements and shall have no obligations, responsibilities, or liabilities thereunder. The Customer represents and warrants that its use of any Non-Provider Application shall comply with all applicable laws and the terms of service, privacy policies, and security protocols mandated by the third-party provider. Any exchange of data or other interaction between the Customer and a third-party provider is solely between the Customer and such third-party provider.

10.3 Authorization for Data Transfer and Processing. If the Customer enables, installs, or uses a Non-Provider Application in conjunction with the Services, the Customer hereby grants the Provider an express, irrevocable, and royalty-free license and permission to allow the provider of that Non-Provider Application to access, transmit, process, and store Customer Data as required for the functional interoperation of that Non-Provider Application with the Services. The Provider shall not be responsible or liable for any disclosure, modification, corruption, or deletion of Customer Data resulting from any access or transmission by or to a Non-Provider Application or its provider. The Customer acknowledges that the privacy and data security practices of the third-party provider may differ significantly from those of the Provider and that the Provider’s data protection obligations hereunder do not extend to data handled by third parties.

10.4 Disclaimer of Warranties. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROVIDER DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, CONCERNING NON-PROVIDER APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. THE PROVIDER DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE INTEGRATION WITH ANY NON-PROVIDER APPLICATION WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, SECURE, OR COMPATIBLE WITH FUTURE VERSIONS OF THE SERVICES. ALL THIRD-PARTY INTEGRATIONS ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS.

10.5 Limitation of Liability. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL THE PROVIDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR USE, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE CUSTOMER'S ACCESS TO, USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE ANY NON-PROVIDER APPLICATION, OR FOR ANY ACT OR OMISSION OF ANY THIRD-PARTY PROVIDER. THIS LIMITATION APPLIES REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL THEORY ASSERTED AND EVEN IF THE PROVIDER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THE CUSTOMER ASSUMES ALL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF NON-PROVIDER APPLICATIONS.

10.6 Interoperability and Continuity of Service. The continued availability of features designed to interoperate with Non-Provider Applications is contingent upon the continued availability of the applicable third-party APIs and services. If the provider of a Non-Provider Application ceases to make the Non-Provider Application available for interoperation with the corresponding Service features on terms deemed reasonable by the Provider, or if the Provider determines that such integration poses a security risk, technical burden, or legal liability, the Provider may cease providing such Service features without entitling the Customer to any refund, credit, or other compensation. The Provider reserves the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue any third-party integration at any time, in its sole and absolute discretion, without prior notice.

10.7 Indemnification. The Customer shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Provider and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, costs, damages, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs) arising out of or in connection with a claim by a third party alleging that the Customer's use of a Non-Provider Application, or the Provider’s transmission of Customer Data to a Non-Provider Application pursuant to the Customer's instructions, violates any applicable law, regulation, or the intellectual property, privacy, or other rights of any third party.

## 11. Fees, Invoicing, and Payment Terms

11. FEES, INVOICING, AND PAYMENT TERMS

11.1 Service Fees. As consideration for the performance of the Services and the delivery of any Work Product, the Client shall pay to the Provider the fees set forth in the applicable Statement of Work or Service Schedule (the "Fees"). Unless otherwise expressly stipulated in writing, all Fees are quoted and shall be remitted in United States Dollars. The Fees are calculated based on the scope of Services defined as of the Effective Date; any material deviation from the scope, or additional requirements requested by the Client, shall be subject to the Change Control Procedures and may result in additional charges at the Provider's then-current standard rates.

11.2 Reimbursable Expenses. In addition to the Fees, the Client shall reimburse the Provider for all reasonable, necessary, and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Provider, its employees, or its subcontractors in connection with the performance of the Services (the "Expenses"). Reimbursable Expenses may include, but are not limited to, airfare, ground transportation, lodging, meals, courier services, and third-party software licensing specifically required for the Project. All Expenses exceeding five hundred dollars ($500.00) individually shall require the Client’s prior written approval.

11.3 Invoicing Procedures. The Provider shall submit invoices to the Client on a monthly basis in arrears, unless an alternative billing cycle is specified in a Statement of Work. Each invoice shall provide a detailed itemization of the Services rendered, the corresponding Fees, and a summary of Expenses. For Services billed on a time-and-materials basis, invoices shall include a summary of hours worked by personnel category. The Client shall be responsible for providing the Provider with any purchase order numbers or internal billing references required for processing at least ten (10) business days prior to the invoice date.

11.4 Payment Terms. The Client shall pay all undisputed amounts set forth in each invoice within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the invoice (the "Due Date"). All payments shall be made via electronic funds transfer (EFT), Automated Clearing House (ACH), or wire transfer to the bank account designated by the Provider. Payment shall be deemed made only upon the receipt of cleared funds. All payments due hereunder shall be made in full without any set-off, deduction, counterclaim, or withholding of any kind.

11.5 Taxes. All Fees and Expenses are exclusive of any and all applicable sales, use, value-added (VAT), goods and services (GST), excise, consumption, or other similar taxes, duties, and government levies (collectively, "Taxes") now or hereafter imposed by any relevant taxing authority. The Client shall be responsible for the timely payment of all such Taxes associated with the Services, excluding only those taxes based solely upon the Provider’s net income or corporate franchise. If the Client is required by law to deduct or withhold any Taxes from payments due to the Provider, the Client shall gross up the payment such that the Provider receives a net amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding been required.

11.6 Late Payment Penalties and Interest. Any amount not paid by the Due Date shall be subject to a late payment charge equal to the lesser of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month (18% per annum) or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law. Interest shall accrue on a daily basis from the Due Date until the date of actual payment in full. Furthermore, the Client shall indemnify and hold the Provider harmless from all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and collection agency commissions, incurred by the Provider in connection with the collection of any delinquent accounts.

11.7 Disputed Invoices. If the Client, in good faith, disputes any portion of an invoice, the Client must provide written notice of such dispute to the Provider within ten (10) business days of the invoice date (the "Dispute Period"). Such notice shall clearly identify the disputed amount and the specific factual or contractual basis for the objection. Failure to notify the Provider of a dispute within the Dispute Period shall constitute an irrevocable waiver of the Client’s right to dispute the invoice and an admission that the invoice is correct and payable. The Client shall pay the undisputed portion of the invoice in full by the Due Date. The parties shall work diligently and in good faith to resolve any disputed amounts within fifteen (15) days of the dispute notice.

11.8 Suspension of Services. In the event that any undisputed invoice remains unpaid for fifteen (15) days beyond the Due Date, the Provider reserves the right, in its sole discretion and without prejudice to any other legal or equitable remedies, to suspend the performance of all Services and withhold any deliverables or Work Product until all outstanding balances, including accrued interest, are paid in full. The Provider shall have no liability for any damages, losses, or project delays sustained by the Client resulting from such suspension of performance.

11.9 Rate Adjustments. The Provider may, at its discretion, adjust its standard hourly rates and fee schedules effective upon the commencement of any Renewal Term or on an annual basis. The Provider shall provide the Client with at least sixty (60) days’ prior written notice of any such adjustment. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, annual increases shall not exceed the greater of five percent (5%) or the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the preceding twelve-month period.

## 12. Taxes, Withholdings, and Duties

12.1 Tax Responsibility and General Obligation. All fees, rates, and charges set forth in this Agreement or any applicable Statement of Work are exclusive of any and all taxes, levies, duties, or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, without limitation, value-added tax (VAT), sales and use taxes, goods and services tax (GST), excise, consumption, transfer, or other similar taxes, whether federal, state, local, or foreign, together with any interest, penalties, or additions thereto (collectively, “Taxes”). The Customer shall be solely responsible for the timely payment and discharge of all Taxes associated with its purchases, licensing, or receipt of services hereunder, excluding only those taxes based specifically upon the Provider’s net income, corporate franchise, property, or employees.

12.2 Invoicing and Collection. If the Provider is legally required by a taxing authority to collect or pay Taxes for which the Customer is responsible under this Section, the Provider shall invoice the Customer for such amounts, and the Customer shall remit payment for such Taxes in accordance with the payment terms set forth herein, unless the Customer provides the Provider with a valid, timely, and sufficient tax exemption certificate or other documentation authorized by the appropriate taxing authority demonstrating that no tax is due. The Customer’s failure to provide such documentation shall result in the immediate liability for such Taxes as invoiced.

12.3 Withholding and Gross-Up. All payments made by the Customer to the Provider shall be made free and clear of, and without any deduction or withholding for or on account of, any Taxes. If any applicable law requires the Customer to deduct or withhold any Taxes from any payment due to the Provider, the Customer shall (a) notify the Provider in writing of such requirement, (b) pay the required amount to the relevant taxing authority in a timely manner, and (c) increase the amount payable to the Provider (a “Gross-Up”) by such additional amount as is necessary to ensure that the Provider receives and retains a net amount equal to the full amount it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been required. The Customer shall provide the Provider with official tax receipts or other evidence of payment issued by the relevant governmental authority within thirty (30) days of such payment.

12.4 Customs, Duties, and Import/Export Levies. In the event that any deliverables, hardware, or software are transferred across international borders pursuant to this Agreement, the Customer shall be the importer of record and shall be responsible for all customs duties, tariffs, brokerage fees, and import/export assessments. The Customer shall ensure compliance with all applicable trade regulations and shall bear all costs associated with the clearance of goods through customs.

12.5 Tax Indemnification. The Customer hereby agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Provider and its affiliates, officers, and directors from and against any and all claims, liabilities, losses, costs, expenses, or damages (including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of litigation) arising out of or resulting from the Customer’s failure to accurately report, pay, or remit any Taxes, duties, or assessments for which it is responsible under this Section. This indemnification obligation shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement for the duration of the applicable statute of limitations.

12.6 Cooperation and Dispute Resolution. The parties agree to cooperate in good faith to minimize any Tax liability to the extent legally permissible. This includes the timely provision of any necessary documentation, certificates, or information regarding the nature of the transaction or the tax residency of the parties. In the event of an audit or assessment by a taxing authority relating to Taxes for which the Customer is responsible, the Customer shall have the right, at its own expense, to contest such assessment, provided that the Customer keeps the Provider fully informed and ensures that such contest does not adversely affect the Provider’s tax standing or operational status.

## 13. Audit Rights and Record Keeping

13. AUDIT RIGHTS AND RECORD KEEPING

13.1 Maintenance of Records. During the Term of this Agreement and for a period of seven (7) years following the termination or expiration hereof, or for such longer period as may be required by applicable law, regulation, or accounting standard, the Service Provider shall maintain full, complete, and accurate books, records, data, accounts, and documentation (collectively, the “Records”) pertaining to all aspects of its performance under this Agreement. Such Records shall include, without limitation, all financial transactions, invoices, payroll data, time logs, expense reports, security logs, sub-processor agreements, and evidence of compliance with the operational, technical, and security specifications set forth herein.

The Customer, or an independent, reputable third-party auditor selected by the Customer and reasonably acceptable to the Service Provider (the “Auditor”), shall have the right, upon no less than ten (10) business days’ prior written notice, to inspect, examine, and audit the Records and the Service Provider’s facilities, systems, and internal controls relevant to the performance of this Agreement. Such audits shall be conducted during regular business hours and in a manner designed to minimize unreasonable disruption to the Service Provider’s normal business operations. Unless otherwise required by a regulatory authority or initiated due to a suspected material breach, the Customer shall exercise such audit rights no more than once per calendar year.

13.3 Cooperation and Access. The Service Provider shall provide the Customer or the Auditor with full access to the Records and such personnel, premises, and information technology systems as are reasonably necessary to facilitate the audit process. The Service Provider shall cooperate in good faith with the Auditor, providing all necessary assistance, answering inquiries, and producing digital or physical copies of any Records requested. Failure to provide such access or cooperation shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement.

13.4 Audit Costs. The Customer shall bear the initial costs and expenses of any audit conducted pursuant to this Section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any audit reveals (i) an underpayment of fees or an overcharge to the Customer exceeding five percent (5%) of the total amounts due for the audited period, or (ii) a material deficiency in the Service Provider’s performance or internal controls, the Service Provider shall, within thirty (30) days of written demand, reimburse the Customer for the full cost of the audit, including the fees of the Auditor and any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred.

13.5 Remediation and Settlement. If an audit identifies any financial discrepancy, the responsible party shall remit the deficient amount to the other party within thirty (30) days of the issuance of the final audit report, together with interest at a rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, calculated from the date such amount was originally due or overcharged. If an audit identifies any non-financial compliance deficiencies, the Service Provider shall, at its own expense, promptly develop and implement a corrective action plan to remediate such deficiencies within a timeframe reasonably specified by the Customer.

13.6 Confidentiality of Audit Results. All information, findings, and reports generated through an audit conducted pursuant to this Section shall be deemed Confidential Information of both parties and shall be subject to the non-disclosure obligations set forth in this Agreement. The Auditor shall be required to execute a non-disclosure agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to the Service Provider prior to commencing the audit, provided that such agreement shall not restrict the Auditor from reporting its full findings to the Customer.

13.7 Regulatory and Statutory Audits. The Service Provider acknowledges that the Customer may be subject to oversight by governmental or regulatory authorities. The Service Provider agrees to cooperate with any such authorities and to provide access to its Records, facilities, and personnel as required by law or requested by such authorities in connection with their oversight of the Customer’s operations. The Service Provider shall inform the Customer immediately upon receiving any request for access from a regulatory body relating to the services provided under this Agreement, unless prohibited by law from doing so.

## 17. Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure

17. CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON-DISCLOSURE

17.1 Definition of Confidential Information. For the purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential Information" shall mean any and all non-public, proprietary, or sensitive information, whether disclosed orally, in writing, or by any other media, that is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or that should be reasonably understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure. This includes, without limitation, trade secrets, business plans, financial data, customer lists, technical specifications, source code, algorithms, research and development data, marketing strategies, and any information concerning the Disclosing Party’s operations, personnel, or affiliates, as well as the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

17.2 Protection and Non-Use. The Receiving Party shall hold all Confidential Information in strict confidence and shall exercise the same degree of care to prevent unauthorized disclosure as it uses to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature, but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care. The Receiving Party shall use the Confidential Information solely for the purpose of exercising its rights and performing its obligations under this Agreement and shall not disclose, disseminate, or otherwise make available such information to any third party without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party. Access to Confidential Information shall be strictly restricted to those employees, agents, contractors, or professional advisors of the Receiving Party who have a bona fide "need to know" such information for the performance of this Agreement and who are bound by confidentiality obligations no less restrictive than those set forth herein.

17.3 Exclusions from Confidentiality. The obligations of confidentiality set forth in this Section 17 shall not apply to information which the Receiving Party can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence: (a) was already in the public domain at the time of disclosure or subsequently became part of the public domain through no fault, act, or omission of the Receiving Party; (b) was rightfully in the Receiving Party’s possession prior to disclosure by the Disclosing Party, free of any obligation of confidentiality; (c) was independently developed by the Receiving Party without reference to, use of, or reliance upon the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information; or (d) was lawfully obtained from a third party who had the legal right to disclose such information without restriction.

17.4 Compelled Disclosure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to the extent required by a valid order of a court of competent jurisdiction or other governmental body, or as otherwise required by applicable law or regulation; provided, however, that the Receiving Party shall, to the extent legally permissible, provide the Disclosing Party with prompt written notice of such requirement so that the Disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy at its own expense. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, the Receiving Party shall furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which it is legally compelled to disclose and shall exercise all reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to the information so disclosed.

17.5 Return or Destruction of Materials. Upon the written request of the Disclosing Party or immediately upon the expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason, the Receiving Party shall, at the Disclosing Party’s sole election, promptly return to the Disclosing Party or destroy all physical and electronic copies of the Confidential Information in its possession or control, including all notes, summaries, abstracts, or derivative works derived therefrom. The Receiving Party shall, if requested, provide a written certification signed by an authorized executive officer confirming that it has complied with the requirements of this provision. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party may retain one copy of the Confidential Information to the extent required by law or for the purposes of institutional document retention and backup policies, provided that such retained information remains subject to the confidentiality obligations of this Agreement until it is eventually deleted.

17.6 Injunctive Relief. The Receiving Party acknowledges and agrees that the Confidential Information is of a unique and valuable character, and that the unauthorized use or disclosure of the Confidential Information would cause immediate and irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party for which monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy.

19.5. Subprocessor Compliance. The Provider shall ensure that any subcontractors, affiliates, or third-party subprocessors who have access to Customer Data are contractually bound to security obligations no less restrictive than those set forth in this Section 19.

20.1. Definition of Security Breach. For the purposes of this Agreement, a "Security Breach" shall be defined as any actual or reasonably suspected unauthorized access to, acquisition of, disclosure of, loss of, alteration of, or accidental or unlawful destruction of Personal Data, or any other breach of security leading to the compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the data processed by the Provider on behalf of the Client.

20.2. Notification Obligations.

Such notification shall be delivered via the primary contact methods established in this Agreement and shall be supplemented with additional information as it becomes available. The Provider’s obligation to report or respond to a Security Breach under this Section is not and will not be construed as an acknowledgement by the Provider of any fault or liability with respect to the Security Breach.

20.3. Content of Notification. The notification provided to the Client shall, at a minimum, include: (a) a description of the nature of the Security Breach, including the categories and approximate number of data subjects concerned and the categories and approximate number of Personal Data records concerned; (b) the name and contact details of the Provider’s Data Protection Officer or other point of contact where more information can be obtained; (c) a description of the likely consequences of the Security Breach; and (d) a description of the measures taken or proposed to be taken by the Provider to address the Security Breach, including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects.

20.4. Investigation and Remediation. Immediately upon discovery of a Security Breach, the Provider shall: (a) take all necessary and appropriate corrective action to investigate the Security Breach; (b) mitigate the effects of the Security Breach and minimize any damage resulting therefrom; and (c) implement such measures as are necessary to prevent a recurrence of the Security Breach.

20.6. Public Statements and Communication. The Provider shall not make any public statements, press releases, or notifications to any third party (including Data Subjects and regulatory authorities) regarding a Security Breach involving the Client’s data without the prior written express consent of the Client, unless such notification is strictly required by applicable law, in which case the Provider shall provide the Client with prior notice of the required communication and an opportunity to review and comment on the content of such communication.

20.7. Costs and Indemnification. To the extent that a Security Breach is caused by the Provider’s failure to comply with its security obligations under this Agreement or applicable law, the Provider shall be responsible for all costs arising from the Security Breach, including but not limited to: (a) costs of forensic investigation to determine the cause and scope of the breach; (b) costs associated with providing legally mandated notifications to affected individuals, regulators, and other third parties; (c) costs of providing credit monitoring or identity theft restoration services to affected individuals for a period of no less than twelve (12) months; and (d) reasonable legal fees and litigation costs incurred by the Client. The Provider shall indemnify and hold the Client harmless from and against any and all claims, fines, penalties, and damages arising out of or related to such Security Breach.

## 21. Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity

21. DISASTER RECOVERY AND BUSINESS CONTINUITY

21.1 Maintenance of Plans. The Service Provider represents, warrants, and covenants that it has established and shall maintain throughout the Term a comprehensive written Business Continuity Plan (“BCP”) and a Disaster Recovery Plan (“DRP”) (collectively, the “Plans”) designed to ensure the continued availability and reliability of the Services and the integrity of Customer Data in the event of a Disaster. For purposes of this Agreement, a “Disaster” shall be defined as any unplanned interruption of the operations, systems, or infrastructure of the Service Provider, whether caused by fire, flood, earthquake, explosion, war, strike, riot, civil unrest, act of God, pandemic, cyber-attack, or any other force majeure event that significantly impairs the Service Provider’s ability to provide the Services in accordance with the specifications and Service Level Agreements (SLAs) set forth herein.

21.2 Minimum Standards and Redundancy. The Plans shall conform to prevailing industry standards and best practices (including, without limitation, ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO 22301 standards) and shall include, at a minimum: (a) rigorous data backup and recovery procedures; (b) geographic redundancy of critical infrastructure, hardware, and data centers; (c) automated failover capabilities to secondary processing sites; (d) comprehensive crisis management and communication protocols; and (e) established Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) which shall not exceed the maximum thresholds specified in the attached Service Level Exhibit.

21.3 Data Backups. The Service Provider shall perform incremental backups of all Customer Data no less frequently than every four (4) hours and full systemic backups on a daily basis. All backup media shall be encrypted at rest using industry-standard cryptographic modules (AES-256 or higher) and shall be stored in a secure, climate-controlled off-site facility located at a sufficient geographic distance from the primary production environment to ensure that a single regional catastrophic event does not compromise both the primary and backup datasets.

21.4 Testing and Validation. No less than once per calendar year, the Service Provider shall conduct a formal functional test and validation of its Plans to ensure their efficacy and operational readiness. Such testing shall include, but not be limited to, full-scale failover simulations and data restoration verification. Upon written request, the Service Provider shall provide the Customer with an executive summary of the test results, including any identified deficiencies and a detailed remediation roadmap for such deficiencies. The Customer, or its designated independent auditor, shall have the right, upon reasonable prior notice, to review the Plans and inspect the Service Provider’s disaster recovery facilities to verify compliance with the obligations set forth in this Section.

21.5 Invocation and Notification. In the event of a Disaster or any material threat to the continuity of the Services, the Service Provider shall immediately invoke the relevant Plans and notify the Customer’s designated emergency contact as soon as practicable, but in no event later than two (2) hours following the onset of the Disaster. Such notification shall include a detailed description of the event, the anticipated impact on Service delivery, the specific mitigation measures being taken, and the estimated timeline for full restoration of the Services. The Service Provider shall provide the Customer with status updates at intervals of no less than four (4) hours until the Disaster is resolved and normal operations are resumed.

21.6 Relation to Force Majeure. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in the Force Majeure clause of this Agreement, the Service Provider shall not be excused from its performance obligations to the extent that a Disaster or interruption of Services could have been mitigated, avoided, or recovered from through the diligent implementation and execution of the BCP and DRP required under this Section. The failure of the Service Provider to restore the Services within the maximum RTO defined in the SLA following a Disaster shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement, and the Customer shall not be required to pay any fees for the period during which the Services were unavailable.

21.7 Continuous Improvement. The Service Provider shall regularly review and update the Plans to reflect changes in technology, industry standards, and the Service Provider’s internal operational environment. Any material modification to the Plans that results in a degradation of the recovery capabilities or security posture shall require the prior written consent of the Customer. In the event of a merger, acquisition, or restructuring of the Service Provider, the successor entity shall remain bound by the requirements of this Section and shall ensure that disaster recovery capabilities are maintained without interruption during any transition period.

Provider shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Client and its parent, subsidiaries, and affiliates, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, successors, and permitted assigns (each, a "Client Indemnitee"), from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, actions, judgments, settlements, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs, or expenses of whatever kind, including reasonable attorneys' fees, expert witness fees, and the costs of enforcing any right to indemnification under this Agreement, and the cost of pursuing any insurance providers (collectively, "Losses"), arising out of or resulting from any third-party claim, suit, action, or proceeding ("Third-Party Claim") alleging: (a) any breach or non-fulfillment of any representation, warranty, or covenant set forth in this Agreement by Provider or its employees, agents, or subcontractors (collectively, "Provider Personnel"); (b) any negligent or more culpable act or omission of Provider or Provider Personnel (including any reckless or willful misconduct) in connection with the performance of this Agreement; (c) any bodily injury, death of any person, or damage to real or tangible personal property caused by the acts or omissions of Provider or Provider Personnel; (d) any failure by Provider or Provider Personnel to comply with any applicable federal, state, or local laws, regulations, or codes; or (e) any violation of any third-party intellectual property rights, including but not limited to patents, copyrights, trademarks, or trade secrets, arising from Client’s use of the Services or Deliverables as permitted under this Agreement.

24.2 Intellectual Property Indemnification Remedies. In the event of a Third-Party Claim alleging intellectual property infringement, or if Provider reasonably believes the Services or Deliverables are likely to become the subject of such a claim, Provider shall, at its sole cost and expense: (i) obtain the right for Client to continue to use the Services and Deliverables as contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) modify or replace the Services and Deliverables, in whole or in part, to seek to make them non-infringing, while providing substantially equivalent features and functionality; or (iii) if the foregoing options are not commercially practicable for Provider, terminate this Agreement and refund to Client all unused, prepaid fees on a pro-rata basis.

24.3 Indemnification Procedure. Client shall promptly notify Provider in writing of any Third-Party Claim for which it seeks indemnification; provided, that a failure or delay in providing such notice will not relieve Provider of its indemnification obligations except to the extent Provider can demonstrate material prejudice as a direct result of such failure or delay. Provider shall have the right to assume the control of the defense and settlement of the Third-Party Claim; provided, however, that Provider shall not settle any Third-Party Claim without Client's prior written consent if such settlement (a) admits liability on the part of any Client Indemnitee, (b) subjects any Client Indemnitee to any ongoing performance or payment obligations, or (c) does not include a full and unconditional release of the Client Indemnitee from all liability. Client shall have the right, at its own expense, to participate in the defense of any Third-Party Claim with counsel of its own choosing. Provider shall reimburse Client for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Client in providing cooperation requested by Provider in the defense of such Third-Party Claim.

25. CUSTOMER INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS

25.1. General Indemnity. Customer shall, at its sole cost and expense, indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Provider, its parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, successors, and permitted assigns (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, actions, judgments, settlements, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs, or expenses of whatever kind, including reasonable attorneys' fees, expert witness fees, and the costs of enforcing any right to indemnification hereunder and the cost of pursuing any insurance providers (collectively, "Losses"), incurred by any Indemnified Party, arising out of or resulting from any third-party claim, suit, action, or proceeding ("Third-Party Claim") related to, arising out of, or in connection with: (a) any breach or non-fulfillment of any representation, warranty, covenant, or obligation set forth in this Agreement by Customer or Customer’s personnel; (b) any negligent or more culpable act or omission of Customer or its personnel (including recklessness or willful misconduct) in connection with the performance of its obligations under this Agreement; (c) any bodily injury, death of any person, or damage to real or tangible personal property caused by the negligent or more culpable acts or omissions of Customer or its personnel; (d) any failure by Customer or its personnel to comply with any applicable federal, state, or local laws, regulations, or codes; (e) the unauthorized use of the Services or Provider’s intellectual property by Customer or any unauthorized user accessing the Services via Customer’s credentials; or (f) any allegation that the data, content, or other materials provided by Customer to Provider ("Customer Data") infringes, misappropriates, or otherwise violates the intellectual property rights, proprietary rights, or privacy rights of any third party.

25.2. Indemnification Procedures. The Indemnified Party shall provide Customer with prompt written notice of any Third-Party Claim for which it seeks indemnification; provided, however, that any delay in providing such notice shall not relieve Customer of its indemnification obligations except to the extent that Customer is materially and adversely prejudiced by such delay. Customer shall immediately assume control of the defense and investigation of such Third-Party Claim and shall employ counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party to handle and defend the same, at Customer’s sole cost and expense. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense of any Third-Party Claim with counsel of its own choosing at its own cost and expense. Customer shall not settle any Third-Party Claim in a manner that adversely affects the rights of the Indemnified Party, admits liability on the part of the Indemnified Party, or imposes any obligation (monetary or otherwise) upon the Indemnified Party, without the Indemnified Party’s prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed.

25.3. Exclusive Remedy. The indemnification obligations set forth in this Section 25 are in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other remedies or rights that the Indemnified Parties may have at law, in equity, or under this Agreement. Customer’s obligations under this Section shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason. If Customer fails to promptly assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim or fails to prosecute such defense diligently, the Indemnified Party may, without relieving Customer of any of its obligations hereunder, contest, settle, or pay such Third-Party Claim and be entitled to full reimbursement from Customer for all Losses incurred in connection therewith.

## 26. Indemnification Procedures

26. Indemnification Procedures

26.1. Notice of Claim. If any party entitled to indemnification under this Agreement (the “Indemnified Party”) receives notice of the assertion or commencement of any claim, demand, action, suit, or proceeding (each, a “Claim”) made or brought by any third party (a “Third-Party Claim”) for which the other party (the “Indemnifying Party”) is obligated to provide indemnification, the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party prompt written notice thereof. Such notice shall describe the Third-Party Claim in reasonable detail and shall include copies of all material written evidence thereof received by the Indemnified Party. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defenses or is otherwise materially prejudiced by reason of such failure.

26.2. Control of Defense. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in, or by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days of receipt of the notice of the Third-Party Claim, to assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim at the Indemnifying Party's expense and by the Indemnifying Party's own counsel, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith in such defense. In the event that the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third-Party Claim, subject to Section 26.3, it shall have the right to take such action as it deems necessary to avoid, dispute, defend, appeal, or make counterclaims pertaining to any such Third-Party Claim in the name and on behalf of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its own cost and expense, to participate in the defense of any Third-Party Claim with counsel selected by it, subject to the Indemnifying Party's right to control the defense thereof.

26.3. Conflicts of Interest. Notwithstanding Section 26.2, if the Indemnified Party has been advised by counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses available to it which are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Party, or that a conflict of interest exists between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party that would make it inappropriate for the same counsel to represent both parties, then the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to retain its own counsel at the reasonable cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party.

26.4. Settlement of Third-Party Claims. The Indemnifying Party shall not enter into any settlement or compromise of a Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed), unless such settlement or compromise: (a) includes an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all liability in respect of such Third-Party Claim; (b) does not involve the imposition of equitable remedies or any obligation on the Indemnified Party other than the payment of money for which the Indemnified Party will be fully indemnified hereunder; and (c) does not involve any admission of fault, culpability, or violation of Law or the rights of any person by the Indemnified Party.

Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained within this Agreement, the Company reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion and without prior notice or liability to the Customer, to suspend, disable, or otherwise limit the Customer’s (and its Authorized Users’) access to or use of the Services, in whole or in part, effective immediately, if the Company determines that: (a) the Customer or any Authorized User has breached any material term or condition of this Agreement, including but not limited to any violation of the Acceptable Use Policy; (b) the Customer is in default of its payment obligations for a period exceeding five (5) business days from the applicable due date; (c) there exists a reasonable threat to the security, integrity, or availability of the Services, the Company’s infrastructure, or the data of any other customer; (d) such suspension is required to comply with any applicable law, regulation, court order, or request by a governmental or regulatory entity; or (e) the Customer’s use of the Services is suspected to be fraudulent, abusive, or in violation of third-party intellectual property rights.

36.2 Impact of Suspension. During any period of suspension: (a) all rights granted to the Customer under this Agreement shall be immediately stayed; (b) the Customer shall remain liable for all fees and charges incurred through the date of suspension, and all recurring fees and service charges shall continue to accrue and remain payable throughout the duration of the suspension period; (c) the Company shall have no obligation to maintain, provide access to, or archive any Customer Data, and the Company shall not be responsible for any loss of data resulting from the suspension; and (d) the Company shall not be liable to the Customer or any third party for any damages, losses, liabilities, or expenses (including loss of profits or business interruption) arising out of or in connection with the Company’s exercise of its rights under this Section 36.

36.3 Emergency and Maintenance Suspension. The Company further reserves the right to temporarily suspend the Services without liability: (a) for scheduled maintenance, provided the Company uses commercially reasonable efforts to provide advance notice; and (b) for emergency maintenance or security interventions required to address immediate threats to the Service environment. The Company shall exert reasonable efforts to minimize the duration of such interruptions but makes no guarantees regarding uptime during such intervals.

36.4 Reinstatement. If the Services are suspended due to the Customer’s act or omission, the Company may, at its sole discretion, agree to restore access to the Services only after: (a) the Customer has fully cured the underlying breach to the Company’s satisfaction; (b) all outstanding amounts, including accrued interest, late fees, and a discretionary reinstatement fee, have been paid in full; and (c) the Customer has provided written assurances of future compliance in a form acceptable to the Company. The Company reserves the right to impose additional security requirements or modified payment terms as a condition of reinstatement.

36.5 Cumulative Remedies. The right to suspend Services as set forth in this Section 36 is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights or remedies available to the Company at law, in equity, or under this Agreement, including the right to terminate this Agreement for cause. The exercise of the right to suspend shall not be construed as a waiver of the Company’s right to subsequently terminate the Agreement for the same or different causes.

## 37. Effect of Termination

37. EFFECT OF TERMINATION

37.1 General Consequences of Termination. Upon the expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason: (a) all rights, licenses, and authorizations granted by either Party to the other Party hereunder shall immediately terminate and revert to the granting Party; (b) each Party shall immediately cease all use of the other Party’s Intellectual Property, Confidential Information, and any materials or assets provided under this Agreement; and (c) any and all outstanding fees, expenses, or other liquidated amounts owed by a Party as of the effective date of termination shall become immediately due and payable without the necessity of further notice or demand.

37.2 Return of Property and Data. Within fifteen (15) business days following the effective date of termination or expiration, each Party (the "Receiving Party") shall, at the other Party’s (the "Disclosing Party") written election and expense, either return to the Disclosing Party or permanently delete or destroy all Confidential Information, documents, manuals, software, hardware, and other tangible or intangible property of the Disclosing Party then in the Receiving Party's possession or control. Upon request, a duly authorized officer of the Receiving Party shall provide a written certification attesting to such return or destruction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party may retain one (1) copy of Confidential Information solely to the extent required for compliance with applicable law, regulatory requirements, or bona fide internal document retention policies, provided that such retained information shall remain subject to the confidentiality and non-use obligations contained herein until such time as it is destroyed.

37.3 Survival of Provisions. The expiration or termination of this Agreement shall not release either Party from any liability or obligation which, at the time of such expiration or termination, has already accrued or which is intended to survive such expiration or termination. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the provisions of this Agreement relating to Confidentiality, Indemnification, Limitation of Liability, Intellectual Property Rights, Governing Law, Dispute Resolution, and any other provisions which by their nature are intended to survive, shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement for any reason.

37.4 Disclaimer of Termination Damages. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, neither Party shall be liable to the other for any damages, expenditures, investments, or commitments made in connection with this Agreement, or for loss of anticipated profits or prospective business, arising out of or resulting from the expiration or termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the right to terminate this Agreement is absolute and that it has considered the possibility of such termination and the resulting consequences in entering into this Agreement.

37.5 Transition Assistance. Upon the written request of the Customer, and provided that the Customer has paid all outstanding amounts due under this Agreement, the Provider shall cooperate in good faith to provide reasonable transition assistance services for a period not to exceed sixty (60) calendar days from the date of termination (the "Transition Period"). Such assistance shall be intended to facilitate the orderly transfer of the Services to the Customer or a designated third-party successor. All transition services provided by the Provider shall be subject to the payment of additional fees to be negotiated in good faith and documented in a separate Transition Services Agreement or Statement of Work.

37.6 Equitable Relief. Each Party acknowledges that a breach of the obligations set forth in this Section 37 may cause the other Party irreparable harm for which monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy. Accordingly, in the event of such a breach or threatened breach, the non-breaching Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction, without the necessity of posting a bond or proving actual damages, in addition to any other rights or remedies available at law or in equity.

## 38. Post-Termination Transition Services

38. Post-Termination Transition Services

38.1 Transition Assistance Obligation. Upon the expiration or termination of this Agreement, in whole or in part, for any reason, the Provider shall, for a period of up to one hundred eighty (180) days (the "Transition Period"), provide all such cooperation and assistance as the Client may reasonably request to facilitate the orderly, non-disruptive, and seamless migration and transition of the Services to the Client or to a successor service provider designated by the Client (the "Transition Services"). The Provider’s obligation to provide Transition Services is a material obligation and shall survive the termination or expiration of the Agreement.

38.2 Scope of Transition Services. The Transition Services shall include, without limitation: (a) the continued performance of all or a portion of the Services as directed by the Client to maintain business continuity; (b) the development and execution of a comprehensive transition plan outlining the technical, operational, and administrative steps required for handover; (c) the migration, extraction, and delivery of all Client Data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, alongside all necessary metadata and schema documentation; (d) the delivery of all work product, documentation, manuals, and specifications created or maintained in the performance of the Services; (e) the provision of training and knowledge transfer sessions to the Client’s personnel or the successor provider’s personnel regarding the technical environment and operational processes; and (f) the granting of such licenses or sublicenses as are necessary for the Client to continue utilizing any deliverables or third-party components integrated into the Services during the wind-down period.

38.3 Compensation for Transition Services. Except where this Agreement is terminated by the Client due to the Provider’s material breach, the Client shall compensate the Provider for Transition Services at the rates set forth in the applicable Statement of Work or, if not specified, at the Provider’s then-current standard hourly rates. In the event of termination resulting from the Provider’s material breach, the Provider shall provide Transition Services at no cost to the Client for the initial ninety (90) days of the Transition Period, with subsequent services billed at a fifty percent (50%) discount of the Provider's standard rates.

38.4 Continuity of Personnel. During the Transition Period, the Provider shall not, without the prior written consent of the Client, reassign or remove any Key Personnel involved in the delivery of the Services. The Provider shall ensure that sufficient and qualified resources remain dedicated to the account to maintain Service Levels and ensure the integrity of the transition process. Any replacement of personnel during this period must be approved in writing by the Client and shall be subject to a thorough handover process at the Provider’s sole expense.

38.5 Cooperation with Successors. The Provider shall cooperate in good faith with the Client and any third-party successor provider, providing such access to the Provider’s systems, environment, and technical architecture as is reasonably necessary to facilitate the transition, provided that such third party executes a non-disclosure agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to the Provider. The Provider shall not act in any manner that would impede, delay, or frustrate the transition of Services to a successor.

38.6 Final Delivery and Certification. At the conclusion of the Transition Period, the Provider shall provide written certification to the Client that all Client Data has been successfully migrated, all Client-owned assets and hardware have been returned, and all residual Client Confidential Information has been permanently deleted or destroyed from the Provider’s systems in accordance with the data destruction protocols set forth in this Agreement. No final payment for Transition Services shall be due until such certification is received and verified by the Client.

## 39. Return or Destruction of Confidential Information

39. RETURN OR DESTRUCTION OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

39.1. General Obligation. Immediately upon the earlier of (a) the written request of the Disclosing Party at any time and for any reason, or (b) the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement, the Receiving Party shall, at the sole discretion and direction of the Disclosing Party, either promptly return to the Disclosing Party or permanently and securely destroy all Confidential Information then in the possession, custody, or control of the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives. This obligation shall apply to all forms of Confidential Information, including, without limitation, all originals, copies, reproductions, summaries, extracts, and adaptations, whether in physical, electronic, magnetic, optical, or any other tangible or intangible format or media.

39.2. Derivative Materials. The Receiving Party’s obligation to return or destroy Confidential Information shall extend to all documents, memoranda, notes, studies, reports, analyses, compilations, or other materials prepared by or on behalf of the Receiving Party or its Representatives that contain, reflect, incorporate, or are otherwise derived, in whole or in part, from the Confidential Information (collectively, "Derivative Materials"). All such Derivative Materials shall be destroyed in a manner that ensures they are rendered unreadable and irrecoverable.

39.3. Method of Destruction. In the event destruction is elected, the Receiving Party shall employ industry-standard secure destruction methods. For physical documents, this shall include cross-cut shredding or incineration. For electronic and digital data, the Receiving Party shall perform a secure wipe, degaussing, or physical destruction of the storage media to ensure that the Confidential Information cannot be retrieved, reconstructed, or restored through any forensic or technical means. The Receiving Party shall further ensure that all Confidential Information is purged from all servers, databases, cloud storage instances, and personal devices used by its Representatives.

39.4. Certification of Compliance. Within ten (10) business days following the return or destruction of the Confidential Information as required under this Section 39, the Receiving Party shall provide to the Disclosing Party a formal written certificate of compliance. Such certificate shall be executed by a duly authorized senior officer of the Receiving Party and shall definitively attest that all Confidential Information and Derivative Materials have been returned or destroyed in strict accordance with the terms of this Agreement and that no copies, in any form or medium, remain in the possession or control of the Receiving Party or its Representatives.

39.5. Permitted Retention and Exceptions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party may retain: (i) such Confidential Information as is strictly required to be maintained by applicable law, governmental regulation, or professional standards of conduct; and (ii) electronic copies of Confidential Information created through the Receiving Party’s standard, automated backup, and archival procedures. Any such retained Confidential Information shall remain subject to the confidentiality, non-disclosure, and non-use obligations set forth in this Agreement in perpetuity or until such information is eventually destroyed in the ordinary course of the Receiving Party’s document retention policy. The Receiving Party shall not access or use any such retained Confidential Information for any purpose other than as expressly permitted by this Section 39.5.

39.6. Survival of Obligations. The return or destruction of Confidential Information shall not terminate or diminish the Receiving Party’s ongoing obligations of confidentiality and non-use, which shall survive such return or destruction for the duration specified in the survival provisions of this Agreement. Any failure by the Receiving Party to comply with the requirements of this Section 39 shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement, entitling the Disclosing Party to seek immediate injunctive relief and all other available legal and equitable remedies.

## 41. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration

41. DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION

41.1 Good Faith Negotiations. In the event of any controversy, claim, or dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof, or the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate (collectively, a "Dispute"), the parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve such Dispute through informal negotiations. Such informal negotiations shall commence upon the receipt of written notice from one party to the other (a "Notice of Dispute") specifying the nature of the Dispute, the legal basis for the claim, and the specific relief sought.

41.2 Mandatory Binding Arbitration. If the Dispute is not resolved through informal negotiations within forty-five (45) calendar days from the date of receipt of the Notice of Dispute, then such Dispute shall be settled exclusively by final and binding arbitration. The arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA") or JAMS, at the election of the party initiating the claim, in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules then in effect, except as modified by this Section 41. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted and encompasses all Disputes, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether arising during or after the term of this Agreement.

41.3 Venue and Selection of Arbitrator. The seat or legal place of arbitration shall be [Insert Jurisdiction], and the proceedings shall be conducted in the English language. The arbitration shall be heard by a single neutral arbitrator, who shall be a retired judge or an attorney with at least fifteen (15) years of experience in commercial law. If the parties cannot agree upon an arbitrator within twenty (20) calendar days of the commencement of arbitration, the administering body shall appoint the arbitrator in accordance with its rules.

41.4 Class Action and Jury Trial Waiver. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT. FURTHERMORE, ALL CLAIMS SHALL BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, MULTI-PLAINTIFF, OR CONSOLIDATED PROCEEDING. The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s or entity's claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

41.5 Arbitral Award and Finality. The arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings of fact and conclusions of law upon which the award is based. The arbitrator’s award shall be final, non-appealable, and binding on the parties, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award any remedy or relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could order or grant, including, without limitation, specific performance, injunctive relief, and declaratory relief, subject to the limitations of liability set forth elsewhere in this Agreement.

41.6 Costs and Attorneys' Fees. Each party shall initially bear its own costs and expenses, including legal fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with the arbitration proceedings, and shall share equally the fees and administrative costs of the arbitrator and the administering body. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the arbitrator shall have the authority to award the prevailing party its reasonable attorneys' fees, expert witness fees, and costs of arbitration if the arbitrator determines that such an award is warranted under the circumstances or as permitted by applicable statute.

41.7 Confidentiality of Proceedings. Except as may be required by law, regulation, or for the purpose of enforcing or challenging an arbitral award, the parties, their respective counsel, witnesses, and the arbitrator shall maintain the strict confidentiality of all arbitration proceedings, including all documents produced, testimony given, and the terms of any final award or settlement. No party shall make any public announcement regarding the existence or substance of the arbitration without the prior written consent of the other party.

41.8 Interim Relief. Notwithstanding the agreement to arbitrate, either party may seek interim or provisional relief, including but not limited to temporary restraining orders or preliminary injunctions, from a court of competent jurisdiction to protect its intellectual property rights or confidential information, or to maintain the status quo pending the appointment of an arbitrator. The seeking of such relief shall not be deemed a waiver of the requirement to arbitrate under this Section 41.

41.9 Severability of Arbitration Provisions. If any provision or sub-section of this Section 41 is found by a court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect; provided, however, that if the class action waiver set forth in Section 41.4 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 41 (Dispute Resolution and Arbitration) shall be deemed null and void and the Dispute shall be resolved in a court of competent jurisdiction.

## 42. Force Majeure

42. FORCE MAJEURE

42.1. Definition of Force Majeure Event. For the purposes of this Agreement, a "Force Majeure Event" shall mean any act, event, circumstance, or occurrence beyond the reasonable control of the party claiming the benefit of this Section (the "Affected Party"), which by the exercise of due diligence such Affected Party is unable to prevent or provide against, and which renders the performance of the Affected Party's obligations under this Agreement (other than an obligation for the payment of money) impossible, illegal, or commercially impracticable. Force Majeure Events shall include, but are not limited to: (a) acts of God, including fire, flood, earthquake, windstorm, or other natural disaster; (b) war, hostilities (whether war be declared or not), invasion, act of foreign enemies, mobilization, requisition, or embargo; (c) rebellion, revolution, insurrection, military or usurped power, or civil war; (d) contamination by radio-activity from any nuclear fuel, or from any nuclear waste from the combustion of nuclear fuel, radio-active toxic explosive, or other hazardous properties of any explosive nuclear assembly or nuclear component thereof; (e) riot, commotion, strikes, go-slows, lockouts, or disorder, unless solely restricted to employees of the Affected Party or of its subcontractors; (f) acts or threats of terrorism; (g) epidemic, pandemic, or other public health emergency, including resulting governmental lockdowns or travel restrictions; and (h) acts, orders, or regulations of any governmental or regulatory authority.

42.2. Exclusion of Financial Inability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Force Majeure Event shall not include: (a) the Affected Party’s financial inability to perform or lack of adequate funds; (b) changes in market conditions, including changes in the price of goods, services, or raw materials; (c) the Affected Party's failure to pay any amounts due and owing hereunder; or (d) any event caused by the negligence, willful misconduct, or breach of this Agreement by the Affected Party.

42.3. Performance Excused. Neither party shall be deemed to be in breach of this Agreement, or otherwise be liable to the other, by reason of any delay in performance, or non-performance, of any of its obligations hereunder (except for any obligation to pay sums due to the other party) to the extent that such delay or non-performance is caused by a Force Majeure Event. The time for performance of that obligation shall be extended accordingly for a period equal to the delay caused by the Force Majeure Event.

42.4. Notice and Mitigation. The Affected Party shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after the start of the Force Majeure Event, notify the other party in writing of such event, the date on which it started, its anticipated or potential duration, and the effects of the Force Majeure Event on its ability to perform its obligations under the Agreement. The Affected Party shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the effects of the Force Majeure Event and to facilitate the continued performance of its obligations. During the period of the Force Majeure Event, the Affected Party shall provide the other party with regular updates regarding the status of the event and its efforts to resume performance.

42.5. Resumption of Performance. The Affected Party shall resume the performance of its obligations as soon as reasonably practicable after the removal or cessation of the Force Majeure Event and shall notify the other party in writing of the date when performance has resumed or will resume.

42.6. Termination Right. If the Force Majeure Event continues for a continuous period of more than ninety (90) calendar days, either party may terminate this Agreement upon providing ten (10) business days' prior written notice to the other party. In the event of such termination, neither party shall have any further liability to the other, except for: (a) any rights or liabilities which have accrued prior to the date of termination; (b) the payment of all fees and expenses properly incurred for services performed or goods delivered prior to the commencement of the Force Majeure Event; and (c) any obligations which by their nature are intended to survive the termination of this Agreement.

42.7. Allocation of Costs. Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses resulting from the Force Majeure Event. For the avoidance of doubt, the Customer shall not be required to pay for any services or goods that the Provider is unable to provide during the subsistence of a Force Majeure Event.

## 43. Assignment and Subcontracting

43. ASSIGNMENT AND SUBCONTRACTING

43.1 Restriction on Assignment. Neither Party may assign, delegate, pledge, encumber, or otherwise transfer this Agreement, or any of its rights, interests, duties, or obligations hereunder, whether by operation of law, change of control, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, without the prior express written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. Any attempted assignment or delegation in contravention of this Section 43.1 shall be null and void ab initio and shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement. 

43.2 Permitted Assignments. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 43.1, either Party may, upon prior written notice to the other Party but without requiring such other Party’s consent, assign this Agreement in its entirety to (a) an Affiliate of such Party, or (b) a successor-in-interest in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or the sale of all or substantially all of its assets or equity securities; provided, however, that (i) the assignee expressly assumes in writing all obligations and liabilities of the assignor under this Agreement, (ii) the assignee possesses the financial and operational standing requisite to perform the obligations hereunder, and (iii) such assignment is not to a direct competitor of the non-assigning Party.

The Service Provider shall remain fully and primarily responsible and liable for the performance of all Services and the fulfillment of all obligations under this Agreement, regardless of whether such Services or obligations are performed by the Service Provider or a Subcontractor.

43.4 Liability for Subcontractors. Any act, omission, default, or negligence of a Subcontractor, its agents, or employees shall be deemed to be the act, omission, default, or negligence of the Service Provider. No subcontracting arrangement shall relieve the Service Provider of its liabilities or obligations under this Agreement, and the Service Provider shall indemnify, defend, and hold the Client harmless from and against any claims, losses, or damages arising out of the acts or omissions of its Subcontractors.

43.5 Flow-down Obligations. The Service Provider shall ensure that every agreement with a Subcontractor contains provisions that are at least as protective of the Client’s rights and the Service Provider’s obligations as those set forth in this Agreement, specifically including, but not limited to, provisions relating to confidentiality, data protection, intellectual property rights, security protocols, and audit rights. Upon the Client’s reasonable request, the Service Provider shall provide evidence of such flow-down provisions, subject to necessary redactions for commercially sensitive pricing information.

43.6 Binding Effect. Subject to the restrictions on assignment set forth in this Section 43, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns.

## 44. Relationship of the Parties

44. Relationship of the Parties.

Each Party shall remain solely and exclusively responsible for its own acts and omissions and those of its respective officers, directors, employees, agents, and subcontractors. Each Party shall be solely responsible for the payment of all compensation, salaries, and wages to its own personnel, as well as for the withholding and payment of all applicable federal, state, and local taxes, including but not limited to income, social security, payroll, unemployment, and disability taxes. Neither Party’s personnel shall be eligible for, nor shall they have any claim to, any benefits provided by the other Party to its own employees, including but not limited to health insurance, life insurance, retirement benefits, workers' compensation, or disability benefits. Each Party shall maintain its own separate business identity and shall at all times conduct its operations under its own name as an independent entity. This Agreement does not create any third-party beneficiary rights in any person or entity not a party to this Agreement.

## 46. Entire Agreement and Order of Precedence

46. ENTIRE AGREEMENT AND ORDER OF PRECEDENCE

46.1 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with all Exhibits, Schedules, Annexes, Appendices, and Statements of Work attached hereto or incorporated herein by reference, constitutes the sole, final, and entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter contained herein, and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, proposals, term sheets, letters of intent, representations, and warranties, whether written or oral, regarding such subject matter. The Parties acknowledge and agree that in entering into this Agreement, they have not relied upon any statement, representation, warranty, or covenant (whether made negligently or innocently) of any person (whether a party to this Agreement or not) except as expressly set forth in this Agreement. Each Party irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right it may have to any remedy in respect of any statement, representation, warranty, or covenant not set forth in this Agreement, provided that nothing in this Section shall limit or exclude any liability for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.

46.2 Order of Precedence. In the event of any irreconcilable conflict, inconsistency, or ambiguity between the provisions of the main body of this Agreement and any Exhibit, Schedule, Statement of Work, or other attachment hereto, the following order of precedence shall prevail, in descending order of control: (a) any formally executed amendment to this Agreement signed by authorized representatives of both Parties subsequent to the Effective Date; (b) the main body of this Agreement; (c) the applicable Statement of Work; (d) the Exhibits or Schedules to this Agreement; and (e) any other documents or instruments incorporated herein by reference. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Statement of Work may expressly supersede or deviate from a specific provision of the main body of this Agreement only if such Statement of Work: (i) explicitly identifies by section number the specific provision of the Agreement to be superseded; (ii) contains a clear and unambiguous statement of the Parties' intent to deviate from said provision for the purposes of that specific Statement of Work only; and (iii) is executed by a duly authorized officer of each Party. Any such deviation shall be strictly construed and shall apply only to the services or deliverables governed by that specific Statement of Work.

46.3 Modification and Waiver. No amendment to, modification of, or rescission of this Agreement shall be effective unless it is in writing, specifically identifies itself as an amendment to this Agreement, and is signed by an authorized representative of each Party. No waiver by any Party of any of the provisions hereof shall be effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and signed by the Party so waiving. No failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, any right, remedy, power, or privilege arising from this Agreement shall operate or be construed as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power, or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power, or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law or in equity.

## 47. Amendments and Modifications

47. AMENDMENTS AND MODIFICATIONS. No amendment, variation, modification, alteration, or supplement to this Agreement, or any schedule, exhibit, or annex attached hereto, shall be valid, effective, or binding upon the Parties unless such amendment is reduced to writing, expressly references this Agreement, and is duly executed by the authorized signatories of each Party. No oral agreements, statements, promises, undertakings, or course of conduct by or between the Parties, whether occurring prior to, contemporaneous with, or subsequent to the execution of this Agreement, shall be deemed to constitute an amendment or modification hereof, nor shall any such conduct be utilized to vary, explain, or supplement the express terms set forth herein. The Parties hereby expressly waive any right to claim a modification of this Agreement based on any oral communication or the partial or full performance of any alleged oral modification. The requirement for a written instrument signed by all Parties shall be strictly construed, and no waiver of this Section 47 shall be valid unless such waiver is itself in writing and signed in accordance with the aforementioned formalities. No delay or omission on the part of any Party in exercising any right, power, or remedy provided by law or under this Agreement shall impair such right, power, or remedy or be construed as a waiver thereof or an acquiescence in any breach. Any waiver or consent granted in one instance shall not be construed as a bar to or waiver of any right or remedy on any future occasion. This Section 47 constitutes a material inducement for the Parties to enter into this Agreement, ensuring the certainty and finality of the contractual terms expressed herein. Any purported modification or amendment that fails to strictly adhere to the formal requirements of this Section shall be null, void, and of no legal force or effect.

## 48. Severability

48. Severability. 
If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any person, entity, or circumstance, shall for any reason and to any extent be held by a court of competent jurisdiction or an administrative agency of compliant authority to be invalid, void, illegal, or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the remainder of the provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired, or invalidated thereby. The parties hereto expressly intend and agree that each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is adjudicated to be unenforceable because of its scope, duration, geographical area, or other restricted parameter, the parties agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to "blue pencil" or otherwise reduce or modify the scope, duration, area, or other provision, and in its reduced or modified form, said provision shall then be enforceable and shall be enforced. It is the further intent of the parties that they would have executed the remaining portions of this Agreement without including any such parts or portions which may, for any reason, be hereafter declared invalid, illegal, or unenforceable. To the extent permitted by law, the parties hereby waive any provision of law that would render any provision hereof prohibited or unenforceable in any respect. If the excision of any such invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision materially affects the economic substance of the transactions contemplated hereby, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to replace such provision with a valid, legal, and enforceable provision the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision in any specific jurisdiction shall not affect the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.

## 49. Waiver

49. Waiver. No failure or delay by any party hereto in exercising any right, power, or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law or in equity. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement, nor consent to any departure by any party therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the party against whom enforcement of such waiver or consent is sought, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given. No notice to or demand on a party in any case shall entitle such party to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances. The failure of any party to insist upon strict performance of any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of any rights or remedies that such party may have and shall not be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach or default in the terms and conditions herein contained. Any waiver, amendment, or modification of this Agreement must be in writing and signed by the party to be bound thereby. No course of dealing between the parties or any delay or omission on the part of any party in exercising any rights hereunder shall operate as a waiver of any such rights. All waivers shall be strictly construed against the party claiming the benefit of the waiver.

## 50. Counterparts and Electronic Signatures

50. Counterparts and Electronic Signatures. This Agreement, and any amendment, restatement, supplement, or other modification hereto, or any other document delivered pursuant hereto, may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which when executed and delivered shall be deemed to be an original, and all of which counterparts, when taken together, shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery of an executed signature page to this Agreement by facsimile transmission or in portable document format (.pdf) or other electronic imaging format by electronic mail shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. The parties hereto agree that the transactions contemplated hereby may be conducted and this Agreement may be signed by electronic signature, which shall be considered as an original signature for all purposes and shall have the same force and effect as an original manual signature. For purposes of this Agreement, "electronic signature" shall include, without limitation, electronically scanned and transmitted versions (e.g., via pdf) of an original signature or signatures created or transmitted through electronic signature technology (including, without limitation, DocuSign, Adobe Sign, or any other similar platform) in accordance with the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (ESIGN), the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA), or any other applicable law. Each party hereto (i) agrees that it will be bound by its own electronic signature, (ii) acknowledges that the other parties will rely on such electronic signature as evidence of its intent to be bound, and (iii) hereby waives any defenses to the enforcement of the terms of this Agreement based on the form of signature or the method of delivery thereof. A photocopy or electronic reproduction of this Agreement or any counterpart shall be as effective as an original for all purposes. No party shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or the use of electronic mail or other electronic transmission or the use of an electronic signature as a defense to the formation or enforceability of a contract, and each such party forever waives any such defense. The parties agree that this Agreement may be stored electronically and that any such electronic record shall be considered an "original" for all purposes to the same extent as a paper record.
