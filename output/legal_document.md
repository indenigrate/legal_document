## 4. Structure of Agreement and Orders

[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'This is a formal, comprehensive legal draft for **Section 4: Structure of Agreement and Orders**. It is designed for use in a Master Service Agreement (MSA), Professional Services Agreement, or Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) Framework Agreement.\n\n***\n\n### 4. STRUCTURE OF AGREEMENT AND ORDERS\n\n**4.1 Framework Nature of Agreement.** This Agreement constitutes a master framework under which the Customer may, from time to time, procure Services, Deliverables, or Cloud Services from the Provider. This Agreement sets forth the general terms and conditions applicable to all such transactions, but does not, in and of itself, represent a commitment by the Customer to purchase, or by the Provider to provide, any specific volume of Services or Deliverables except as expressly set forth in an executed Order (as defined below).\n\n**4.2 Incorporation of Orders.** The specific details of the Services to be performed and the Deliverables to be provided shall be set forth in one or more mutually executed documents, which may be designated as a "Statement of Work," "Work Order," "Service Schedule," or "Purchase Order" (each, an **"Order"**). Each Order shall be valid only when executed by authorized representatives of both Parties. Upon execution, each Order shall be incorporated into and governed by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Any terms provided in a Customer-issued purchase order, acknowledgment form, or other business documentation that are in addition to or inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement or the applicable Order shall be deemed null, void, and of no effect, notwithstanding any signature or acceptance by the Provider.\n\n**4.3 Order of Precedence.** In the event of any irreconcilable conflict, inconsistency, or ambiguity between the body of this Agreement and any Order, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail and control, except to the extent that an Order expressly identifies a specific provision of this Agreement and explicitly states the Parties\' intent to deviate from or supersede that specific provision for the purposes of that Order only. Any such permitted deviation shall be effective only for the specific Order in which it is contained and shall not be construed as a general amendment to this Agreement for any other purpose or subsequent Order.\n\n**4.4 Independent Validity of Orders.** Each Order shall constitute a separate and independent contractual obligation. Unless otherwise expressly provided in the applicable Order or this Agreement, the termination or expiration of a single Order shall not affect the validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any other outstanding Orders. Conversely, the termination of this Agreement for cause shall, at the non-breaching Party’s sole discretion, result in the immediate termination of all outstanding Orders then in effect.\n\n**4.5 Modification and Change Orders.** No modification, amendment, or variation of an executed Order shall be effective unless recorded in a written "Change Order" signed by authorized representatives of both Parties. The Change Order must specify with particularity the changes to the scope of work, timeline, Deliverables, and any corresponding adjustments to the Fees. Provider shall not be obligated to commence work on any requested changes, and Customer shall not be liable for any additional Fees associated therewith, until a Change Order has been fully executed.\n\n**4.6 Non-Exclusivity.** This Agreement is non-exclusive. Nothing herein shall be construed as: (a) requiring Customer to procure Services or Deliverables exclusively from Provider; (b) restricting Customer from procuring similar services or deliverables from third parties; or (c) restricting Provider from providing similar services or deliverables to other clients, provided that Provider complies with its obligations regarding Confidentiality and Intellectual Property as set forth herein.\n\n**4.7 Execution and Counterparts.** Each Order and any subsequent Change Orders may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. The Parties agree that execution may occur via electronic signature (e.g., DocuSign) and that such electronic signatures shall be deemed as valid and binding as original "wet ink" signatures for all purposes under this Agreement and applicable law.', 'extras': {'signature': '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'}}]

## 5. Grant of Access and License Scope

[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'This is a comprehensive and legally dense draft for **Section 5: Grant of Access and License Scope**, suitable for a SaaS Agreement, Software License, or Professional Services Platform.\n\n***\n\n### 5. Grant of Access and License Scope\n\n**5.1. Limited License Grant.** Subject to the Customer’s continued compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the timely payment of all applicable Fees set forth in the Order Form, the Provider hereby grants to the Customer, during the Term, a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable, and worldwide right and license to:\n(a) access and use the Platform and the Services solely for the Customer’s internal business operations;\n(b) allow Authorized Users to access the Platform in accordance with the seat count or capacity limitations specified in the Order Form; and\n(c) view, download, and reproduce the Documentation solely for the purpose of supporting the Customer’s authorized use of the Services.\n\n**5.2. Authorized Users.** Access to the Services is strictly limited to the specific number of Authorized Users identified in the Order Form. The Customer shall ensure that each Authorized User is assigned a unique set of credentials (username and password) and that such credentials are not shared, transferred, or otherwise disclosed to any third party or between multiple individuals. The Customer shall be solely responsible and liable for all activities occurring under the accounts of its Authorized Users and for any breach of this Agreement by its Authorized Users. The Provider reserves the right to audit the Customer’s use of the Platform to ensure compliance with the Authorized User limitations.\n\n**5.3. Scope of Permitted Use.** The license granted herein is restricted to the object code version of the Software as hosted by the Provider. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as granting the Customer any right, title, or interest in the Source Code of the Platform. The Customer’s use of the Services shall not exceed the usage metrics, storage capacities, or API call limits established in the applicable Service Level Agreement (SLA) or Order Form. Any use in excess of these limits may be subject to additional "overage" fees as specified in the Provider’s then-current price list.\n\n**5.4. Prohibited Actions and Restrictive Covenants.** The Customer shall not, and shall not permit any third party to:\n(a) decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or otherwise attempt to derive the Source Code, underlying ideas, algorithms, or structure of the Platform, except to the extent such restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law;\n(b) modify, adapt, translate, or create derivative works based upon the Services or Documentation;\n(c) rent, lease, distribute, sell, resell, assign, or otherwise transfer rights to the Services to any third party, or use the Services for timesharing or service bureau purposes;\n(d) circumvent or disable any security, monitoring, or technological features or measures of the Services;\n(e) use the Services to store or transmit infringing, libelous, or otherwise unlawful or tortious material, or to store or transmit material in violation of third-party privacy rights;\n(f) interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Services or the data contained therein; or\n(g) access the Services for the purpose of building a competitive product or service or for any other benchmarking or competitive analysis.\n\n**5.5. Reservation of Rights.** The Provider and its licensors retain all right, title, and interest, including all Intellectual Property Rights, in and to the Platform, the Services, the Documentation, and any updates, upgrades, enhancements, customizations, or modifications thereto, whether or not developed based on the Customer’s feedback or suggestions. No implied licenses are granted under this Agreement, and all rights not expressly granted to the Customer are reserved by the Provider.\n\n**5.6. Documentation and Updates.** The scope of this license extends to any updates, patches, bug fixes, or new releases of the Platform that the Provider, in its sole discretion, makes generally available to its customer base during the Term. All such updates shall be deemed part of the "Platform" and subject to the terms of this Section 5. The Customer acknowledges that the Provider may, from time to time, update the functionality and user interface of the Platform, provided that such updates do not materially diminish the core functionality of the Services purchased by the Customer.\n\n**5.7. Third-Party Components.** The Platform may contain or be provided with open-source software or third-party components. To the extent required by the license terms governing such third-party components, those terms shall apply in lieu of the terms of this Section 5, but only with respect to the specific third-party component.

## 6. Authorized Users and Account Management

[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'This is a professionally drafted, comprehensive legal section suitable for a SaaS (Software as a Service), enterprise platform, or complex digital service agreement.\n\n***\n\n### 6. AUTHORIZED USERS AND ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT\n\n**6.1 Account Creation and Eligibility.** To access the Services, Customer must create a primary administrative account (the “Master Account”). Customer represents and warrants that all information provided during the registration process is current, accurate, and complete. Use of the Services is restricted to legal entities or individuals at least eighteen (18) years of age. Customer is strictly prohibited from providing false information or creating an account on behalf of any third party without express written authorization.\n\n**6.2 Definition and Designation of Authorized Users.** Customer may permit its employees, independent contractors, or representatives to access and use the Services under Customer’s Master Account (each, an “Authorized User”). The number of Authorized Users shall be limited to the maximum number of “seats” or licenses purchased as specified in the applicable Order Form. Each Authorized User must be assigned a unique set of login credentials (a “User ID”). Access to the Services is granted solely for Customer’s internal business purposes and is non-transferable.\n\n**6.3 Credential Security and Responsibility.** Customer and its Authorized Users are solely responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality of all User IDs, passwords, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) tokens. Customer shall implement industry-standard security measures to prevent unauthorized access. Any actions, omissions, or transactions initiated through Customer’s account or by any Authorized User shall be deemed the actions of the Customer. The Provider shall not be liable for any loss or damage arising from Customer’s failure to safeguard its account credentials.\n\n**6.4 Prohibited Account Activity.** Account credentials may not be shared, pooled, or used by more than one individual Authorized User. Customer shall not: (a) circumvent any technical limitations or usage quotas; (b) lease, sub-license, or resell access to the Services; (c) permit access by a competitor of the Provider; or (d) use the Services for any fraudulent or malicious purpose. Any “bot,” “script,” or automated method of account creation or login is strictly prohibited and constitutes a material breach of this Agreement.\n\n**6.5 Customer Oversight and Compliance.** Customer assumes full legal and financial responsibility for the conduct of all Authorized Users. Customer shall ensure that all Authorized Users are aware of, and comply with, the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and any applicable Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). Any breach of this Agreement by an Authorized User shall be deemed a breach by the Customer. Customer agrees to indemnify and hold Provider harmless against any claims arising from the actions of its Authorized Users.\n\n**6.6 Notification of Unauthorized Access.** Customer shall immediately notify Provider in writing (via [Insert Support Email/Portal]) upon becoming aware of any actual or suspected unauthorized use of its account, compromise of credentials, or any other breach of security. Upon such notification, Provider reserves the right to suspend the affected account(s) or require a mandatory password reset to mitigate further risk.\n\n**6.7 Audit Rights and Verification.** Provider reserves the right, but not the obligation, to monitor and audit account usage to verify compliance with the license limits and terms of this Agreement. If an audit reveals that Customer has exceeded the permitted number of Authorized Users or has engaged in unauthorized account sharing, Customer shall be liable for additional fees at Provider’s then-current list price, retroactive to the date the overage commenced, without prejudice to any other remedies available to Provider at law or equity.\n\n**6.8 Account Suspension and Termination.** Provider reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to suspend or terminate any Master Account or individual Authorized User ID, without prior notice, if Provider reasonably suspects a violation of this Section 6, a threat to the security or integrity of the Services, or any illegal activity. Following the termination of this Agreement or any specific account, Customer’s right to access the Services shall cease immediately, and Provider shall have no obligation to maintain or forward any data associated with the terminated account, subject to applicable law and the Provider’s Data Retention Policy.', 'extras': {'signature': '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'}}]

## 8. Modifications and Updates to the Platform

[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'This section is drafted in a formal, rigorous legal style suitable for a SaaS Terms of Service, End User License Agreement (EULA), or general Platform Terms and Conditions.\n\n***\n\n### 8. Modifications and Updates to the Platform\n\n**8.1. Right to Modify.** [Company Name] (the “Company”) reserves the unilateral right, at its sole and absolute discretion, to modify, enhance, update, alter, or otherwise change the Platform, or any portion thereof, including but not limited to the User interface, features, functionalities, underlying technology, technical specifications, and documentation, at any time and for any reason, without prior notice or liability to the User. Such modifications may include, without limitation, the addition of new features, the removal or sunsetting of existing functionalities, or changes to the method of delivery or accessibility of the Platform.\n\n**8.2. Continuous Development and Iteration.** The User acknowledges and agrees that the Platform is provided as an evolving service. The Company may periodically implement "patches," bug fixes, security updates, and other modifications (collectively, “Updates”) to maintain the integrity, security, and performance of the Platform. The User further acknowledges that certain Updates may be mandatory and may be automatically deployed without the User’s prior consent or knowledge. The Company shall not be responsible for any loss of data, loss of customized settings, or any service interruptions resulting from the implementation of such Updates.\n\n**8.3. Discontinuance of Features.** The Company shall have the right to discontinue or suspend any specific feature, module, or component of the Platform (the “Discontinued Feature”) at any time. While the Company will endeavor to provide reasonable advance notice for the removal of material features, the User agrees that the Company is under no legal obligation to maintain any specific feature or functionality in perpetuity. The discontinuance of a feature shall not entitle the User to any refund, credit, or reduction in fees unless otherwise expressly stated in a separate Service Level Agreement (SLA) or written contract.\n\n**8.4. Hardware and Software Compatibility.** The User acknowledges that the Platform’s performance is contingent upon the User’s hardware, software, and internet connectivity. Subsequent Updates to the Platform may require the User to upgrade their own hardware, operating systems, or third-party software (such as web browsers) to maintain access or optimal performance. The Company is not responsible for any degradation of service or inability to access the Platform resulting from the User’s failure to maintain compatible systems.\n\n**8.5. Modifications to Pricing and Tiers.** Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the Company reserves the right to modify its pricing structures, subscription tiers, and the features included within specific tiers. Any changes to the User’s existing financial obligations will be governed by the notice periods specified in the “Fees and Payment” section of these Terms. Continued use of the Platform after the effective date of a pricing modification constitutes the User’s acceptance of the revised fees.\n\n**8.6. Beta Features and Limited Releases.** From time to time, the Company may provide the User with access to features designated as "Beta," "Preview," "Experimental," or "Early Access" (collectively, “Beta Features”). The User understands that Beta Features are provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" for testing purposes and may contain errors or inaccuracies. The Company may terminate access to Beta Features at any time without notice and may elect never to release such features into general availability.\n\n**8.7. Modification of the Terms.** The Company reserves the right to amend these Terms of Service to reflect changes in the Platform, legal requirements, or business practices. In the event of a material change, the Company will notify the User via the email address associated with their account or through a prominent notice on the Platform. The User’s continued use of the Platform following the posting or notification of such changes shall be deemed as irrevocable acceptance of the modified Terms. If the User does not agree to the modified Terms, their sole and exclusive remedy is to cease use of the Platform and terminate their account.\n\n**8.8. No Liability for Modification.** To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Company shall not be liable to the User or any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of the Platform or any part thereof. The User waives any claim for damages, including but not limited to lost profits or consequential damages, arising out of any changes made to the Platform by the Company.', 'extras': {'signature': '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'}}]

## 9. Service Level Agreement (SLA) and Availability

[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'This is a dense, professional legal draft suitable for a SaaS (Software as a Service) Master Services Agreement (MSA) or Terms of Service. It is designed to protect the Provider while offering a structured framework for the Customer.\n\n***\n\n### 9. SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT (SLA) AND AVAILABILITY\n\n**9.1 Service Commitment.** The Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Services are available to the Customer with a Monthly Uptime Percentage (as defined below) of at least **99.9%** during any monthly billing cycle (the “Service Commitment”). In the event the Provider does not meet the Service Commitment, the Customer will be eligible to receive a Service Credit as described in Section 9.4.\n\n**9.2 Definitions.** \n(a) **“Downtime”** means the total accumulated minutes during a calendar month during which the entire Service is unavailable or inaccessible to the Customer, measured at the Provider’s network gateway. \n(b) **“Monthly Uptime Percentage”** is calculated by subtracting from 100% the percentage of minutes during the month in which the Service was in a state of Downtime, excluding Excused Downtime.\n(c) **“Excused Downtime”** means any period of Downtime caused by: (i) Scheduled Maintenance or Emergency Maintenance; (ii) a Force Majeure event as defined in Section [X] of this Agreement; (iii) the Customer’s internal internet connectivity, local network failure, or telecommunications provider issues; (iv) any systemic internet failure outside the Provider’s reasonable control; (v) the Customer’s equipment, software, or other technology; or (vi) any use of the Service by the Customer that is inconsistent with the Documentation or in breach of this Agreement.\n(d) **“Service Credit”** is a dollar credit, calculated as set forth below, that the Provider may credit back to an eligible account.\n\n**9.3 Maintenance.**\n(a) **Scheduled Maintenance.** The Provider reserves the right to take the Service offline for routine maintenance, upgrades, or system optimization. The Provider shall use reasonable efforts to provide at least forty-eight (48) hours’ advance notice of Scheduled Maintenance via the Service interface or email. Scheduled Maintenance shall, to the extent practicable, be conducted during non-peak business hours (e.g., weekends or 12:00 AM to 4:00 AM UTC).\n(b) **Emergency Maintenance.** In the event that the Provider determines that emergency maintenance is required to address critical security vulnerabilities, stability issues, or other unforeseen exigencies, the Provider may perform such maintenance without prior notice. The Provider shall exert commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the duration of any such emergency interruption.\n\n**9.4 Service Credits.** If the Monthly Uptime Percentage falls below the Service Commitment, the Customer shall, as its sole and exclusive remedy, be entitled to a Service Credit calculated as a percentage of the monthly subscription fees paid for the affected month, according to the following schedule:\n\n| Monthly Uptime Percentage | Service Credit Percentage |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Less than 99.9% but ≥ 99.0% | 10% of monthly fee |\n| Less than 99.0% but ≥ 95.0% | 25% of monthly fee |\n| Less than 95.0% | 50% of monthly fee |\n\n**9.5 Credit Request and Payment Procedures.** To receive a Service Credit, the Customer must submit a written request to the Provider’s support department within thirty (30) days of the end of the month in which the Service Commitment was not met. The request must include: (i) the words "SLA Credit Request" in the subject line; (ii) the dates and times of each Downtime incident claimed; and (iii) logs or documentation corroborating the claimed outage. If the Monthly Uptime Percentage is confirmed by the Provider to be below the Service Commitment, the Provider shall issue the Service Credit to the Customer’s account within one billing cycle following the confirmation. Service Credits are non-refundable, may not be exchanged for cash, and are applicable only to future fees due for the Service.\n\n**9.6 Exclusions and Limitations.** This SLA and any applicable Service Levels do not apply to any performance or availability issues:\n(a) During any period in which the Customer is in arrears or otherwise in breach of its payment obligations;\n(b) Resulting from the Customer’s use of Beta Services, "early access," or "trial" features as designated by the Provider;\n(c) Resulting from the Customer’s failure to adhere to the Provider’s technical specifications or minimum system requirements;\n(d) Caused by third-party integrations, APIs, or data feeds not provided or managed by the Provider.\n\n**9.7 Sole and Exclusive Remedy.** Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Service Credits set forth in this Section 9 shall be the Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy, and the Provider’s entire liability, for any unavailability, non-performance, or failure of the Provider to provide the Services in accordance with the Service Commitment. Any Downtime occurring under the circumstances defined as Excused Downtime shall not be deemed a breach of this Agreement.\n\n***\n\n### Key Drafting Notes for the User:\n*   **The Percentage:** I used 99.9%. If your service is more or less robust, you can adjust this to 99.5% or 99.99%.\n*   **Sole Remedy Clause:** Section 9.7 is critical.

"Error" means a reproducible failure of the Services to substantially conform to the functional specifications set forth in the Documentation.\n\n*   **(a) Severity 1 (Critical):** A total loss of Service functionality or a critical error that prevents the Customer from performing core business functions, with no immediate workaround available. Provider shall acknowledge within [two (2) business hours] and initiate continuous efforts to provide a resolution or workaround.\n*   **(b) Severity 2 (High):** Significant degradation of Service functionality or a failure of a major feature that limits the Customer’s use of the Services. Provider shall acknowledge within [eight (8) business hours] and provide a status update or resolution within [two (2) business days].\n*   **(c) Severity 3 (Minor):** A minor functional error, cosmetic issue, or Documentation inaccuracy that does not materially impede the Customer’s business operations. Provider shall acknowledge within [twenty-four (24) business hours] and address the issue in a future scheduled update or maintenance release.\n\n**10.3 Maintenance Windows and Service Availability.**\n*   **(a) Scheduled Maintenance:** The Provider reserves the right to perform routine maintenance, including but not limited to, system updates, database optimization, and security patching. Scheduled Maintenance shall occur during off-peak hours, and the Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide at least [forty-eight (48) hours] prior electronic notice to the Customer.\n*   **(b) Emergency Maintenance:** In the event of a critical security vulnerability, infrastructure failure, or other unforeseen event that poses an immediate threat to the integrity or availability of the Services, the Provider may perform Emergency Maintenance without prior notice.\n*   **(c) Updates and Upgrades:** Support Services include the provision of all routine updates, bug fixes, and minor version releases (“Updates”). The Provider shall have sole discretion in determining the timing, content, and deployment of such Updates.

The remedies set forth in this Section 10 constitute the Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy for any failure of the Provider to provide Support Services or for any deficiencies in the performance of the Services.\n\n**10.7 End of Life Policy.** The Provider may, from time to time, discontinue Support Services for older versions or specific features of the Services (“End of Life”). The Provider shall provide at least [six (6) months] prior written notice of any End of Life event.

## 11. Professional Services and Implementation

[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'This text is drafted as a comprehensive section for a Master Service Agreement (MSA) or a professional services contract. It uses formal legalese designed to protect the Service Provider while clearly defining the obligations of both parties.\n\n***\n\n### 11. PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AND IMPLEMENTATION\n\n**11.1 Scope of Services.** Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Provider shall perform the professional services (“Professional Services”) and implementation activities (“Implementation”) as specifically described in one or more mutually executed Statements of Work (each, an “SOW”) or a relevant Ordering Document. Each SOW shall detail the specific deliverables (“Deliverables”), technical specifications, project milestones, estimated timelines, and the applicable fee structure (whether Fixed-Fee or Time and Materials). In the event of a conflict between the terms of this Agreement and any SOW, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail unless the SOW expressly states an intent to supersede a specific provision of this Agreement.\n\n**11.2 Change Control Management.** Either party may, at any time, request a modification to the scope of the Professional Services via a written Change Request. The Provider shall evaluate the impact of the requested change on the fees, delivery schedule, and resource allocation. No change to an SOW shall be binding until a formal "Change Order" is executed in writing by authorized representatives of both parties. The Provider shall have no obligation to commence work on any requested change until such Change Order is finalized; meanwhile, the parties shall continue to perform their respective obligations under the then-existing SOW.\n\n**11.3 Personnel and Performance.** The Provider shall determine, in its sole discretion, the personnel required to perform the Professional Services. While the Provider will make reasonable efforts to maintain consistency in its project team, it reserves the right to reassign or replace personnel at any time. The Provider may engage third-party subcontractors to perform any portion of the Services, provided that the Provider remains primary liable for the performance of such subcontractors and their compliance with the confidentiality and data security obligations set forth herein.\n\n**11.4 Customer Cooperation and Dependencies.** The Customer acknowledges that the timely and successful performance of the Professional Services is strictly contingent upon the Customer’s active and good-faith cooperation. Customer shall: (a) provide timely access to necessary data, facilities, systems, and personnel; (b) provide accurate and complete information as requested by the Provider; and (c) perform any "Customer Obligations" or "Assumptions" identified in the SOW. The Provider shall not be liable for any delays, deficiencies, or additional costs resulting from the Customer’s failure to fulfill these dependencies. Any such delays caused by the Customer may result in an equitable adjustment to the project timeline and fees.\n\n**11.5 Delivery and Acceptance.** \n(a) **Deliverable Submission:** Upon completion of a Deliverable, the Provider shall submit the Deliverable to the Customer for review.\n(b) **Acceptance Period:** The Customer shall have five (5) business days (the “Acceptance Period”) to evaluate the Deliverable solely for its material compliance with the specifications set forth in the applicable SOW.\n(c) **Notice of Non-Conformance:** If the Deliverable fails to meet the agreed-upon specifications, the Customer must provide a written, detailed notice of non-conformance within the Acceptance Period. The Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to remediate the Deliverable and resubmit it for a subsequent review.\n(d) **Deemed Acceptance:** A Deliverable shall be deemed irrevocably accepted if (i) the Customer provides written acceptance; (ii) the Customer fails to provide a notice of non-conformance within the Acceptance Period; or (iii) the Customer utilizes the Deliverable in a production environment or for any commercial purpose.\n\n**11.6 Intellectual Property Rights.**\n(a) **Background IP:** Each party retains all right, title, and interest in its pre-existing intellectual property, including any tools, methodologies, or software existing prior to the Effective Date (“Background IP”).\n(b) **Deliverables:** Unless otherwise expressly stated in an SOW, upon full and final payment of all applicable fees, the Provider grants the Customer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license to use the Deliverables solely for its internal business purposes in connection with the licensed use of the Provider’s platform.\n(c) **Work Made for Hire:** No Deliverable shall be considered a "work made for hire" unless specifically designated as such in a signed SOW. The Provider retains all rights to any generic improvements, code, or processes developed during the performance of the Services that are of general applicability.\n\n**11.7 Fees and Expenses.** Professional Services shall be invoiced as set forth in the SOW. Unless otherwise specified, all Services are performed on a "Time and Materials" basis at the Provider’s then-current standard rates. The Customer shall reimburse the Provider for all reasonable, documented, out-of-pocket travel and living expenses incurred in the performance of the Services, provided such expenses comply with the Provider’s standard travel policy or are pre-approved by the Customer.\n\n**11.8 Service Warranty.** The Provider warrants that the Professional Services shall be performed in a professional and workmanlike manner, in accordance with prevailing industry standards.

## 12. Customer Obligations and System Requirements

[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'This is a comprehensive legal draft for **Section 12: Customer Obligations and System Requirements**, designed for use in a SaaS Agreement, Terms of Service, or Master Services Agreement.\n\n***\n\n### 12. Customer Obligations and System Requirements\n\n**12.1. Maintenance of System Requirements.** \nCustomer acknowledges and agrees that the Service is dependent upon Customer’s procurement of and maintenance of compatible hardware, software, and high-speed internet connectivity. Customer shall, at its sole cost and expense, be responsible for: (a) obtaining, maintaining, and upgrading all computer hardware, operating systems, web browsers, and telecommunications services required to access and use the Services; (b) ensuring that its systems meet the minimum technical specifications set forth in the Provider’s published Documentation, as may be amended by Provider from time to time; and (c) the security and integrity of Customer’s own information technology infrastructure. Provider shall not be liable for any performance delays, service interruptions, or functionality degradations resulting from Customer’s failure to maintain the aforementioned System Requirements.\n\n**12.2. Account Security and Access Control.** \nCustomer is exclusively responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of all administrative and user credentials, including but not limited to usernames, passwords, and API keys (collectively, “Credentials”). Customer shall: (a) ensure that Credentials are not shared between individual users or with unauthorized third parties; (b) implement industry-standard security protocols to prevent unauthorized access to the Services; and (c) immediately notify Provider in writing upon becoming aware of any actual or suspected unauthorized use of, or security breach involving, Customer’s account. Customer accepts full legal and financial responsibility for all activities, transactions, and data transmissions occurring under its Credentials, whether or not such actions were authorized by Customer.\n\n**12.3. Provision of Accurate Information.** \nCustomer represents and warrants that all information provided during the registration, configuration, and onboarding process—including billing information, contact details, and technical parameters—is accurate, current, and complete. Customer assumes a continuing obligation to promptly update such information via the Service’s administrative interface or via written notice to Provider. Provider shall have no liability for interruptions in Service or failure to provide notices resulting from Customer’s failure to maintain accurate contact or billing data.\n\n**12.4. Cooperation and Implementation.** \nCustomer shall provide Provider with all necessary cooperation, information, and access to Customer’s personnel and systems as may be reasonably required for Provider to perform its obligations under this Agreement. In the event that Provider’s performance is delayed or impeded by Customer’s failure to provide such cooperation, or by Customer’s provision of inaccurate or incomplete information, Provider shall be relieved of its performance obligations to the extent of such delay and shall not be liable for any resulting damages, credits, or penalties.\n\n**12.5. Compliance with Laws and Acceptable Use.** \nCustomer shall use the Services strictly in compliance with all applicable local, state, federal, and international laws, regulations, and industry-specific mandates, including but not limited to data protection, privacy, and export control laws. Customer further agrees to adhere to Provider’s Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). Customer shall not, and shall not permit any third party to: (a) upload or transmit any malicious code, viruses, or disruptive scripts; (b) use the Services to store or transmit infringing, libelous, or otherwise unlawful or tortious material; or (c) interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Services or the data contained therein.\n\n**12.6. Third-Party Services and Infrastructure.** \nCustomer acknowledges that the Services may integrate with or rely upon third-party applications, APIs, or cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud). Customer is responsible for complying with the terms of service and licensing requirements of any such third-party providers. Provider makes no representations or warranties regarding the continued availability or performance of third-party integrations, and any failure of a third-party service shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement by Provider.\n\n**12.7. Costs and Expenses.** \nUnless otherwise expressly stated in an executed Statement of Work (SOW), Customer is solely responsible for all costs associated with its use of the Services, including but not limited to data egress charges, third-party software licensing, internal IT support, and internet service provider fees.\n\n**12.8. Consequences of Non-Compliance.** \nAny breach of the obligations set forth in this Section 12 shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement. In addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity, Provider reserves the right to suspend Customer’s access to the Services, without prior notice or liability, if Provider reasonably determines that Customer’s failure to meet its obligations poses a threat to the security, integrity, or availability of the Services or Provider’s network.\n\n***\n\n### *Legal Disclaimer:*\n*This text is provided for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice.

## 13. Fees, Pricing Structure, and Price Adjustments

[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'This text is designed for a master service agreement (MSA), SaaS agreement, or professional services contract. It is drafted to be robust, favoring the provider while maintaining standard commercial protections for both parties.\n\n***\n\n### 13. FEES, PRICING STRUCTURE, AND PRICE ADJUSTMENTS\n\n**13.1. Fee Obligation.** Customer agrees to pay [Company Name] (the “Provider”) all fees specified in the applicable Order Form, Statement of Work (“SOW”), or online checkout process (collectively, the “Fees”). Unless explicitly stated otherwise in writing: (i) Fees are based on Services purchased and not actual usage; (ii) payment obligations are non-cancelable and Fees paid are non-refundable; and (iii) quantities purchased cannot be decreased during the relevant subscription term or service period.\n\n**13.2. Pricing Structure and Calculation.** The pricing structure shall be governed by the specific model designated in the Order Form, which may include:\n*   **(a) Fixed Fees:** A flat-rate recurring or one-time charge for defined deliverables or subscription access.\n*   **(b) Usage-Based/Consumption Pricing:** Fees calculated based on the volume of data, transactions, seats, or other metrics processed by the Service. Provider’s internal records shall be the definitive measurement of usage for billing purposes.\n*   **(c) Tiered Pricing:** Fees applied based on the highest tier reached within a billing cycle, or a graduated scale as defined in the Order Form.\n*   **(d) Overages:** If Customer’s use of the Services exceeds the capacity or limits set forth in the Order Form, Customer shall be charged for such excess usage at the then-current list price or as otherwise specified in the Agreement.\n\n**13.3. Invoicing and Payment Terms.** Provider will invoice Customer in advance for subscription services and in arrears for usage-based services or as otherwise specified. All invoices are due and payable within thirty (30) days of the invoice date (“Due Date”) via [ACH/Wire Transfer/Credit Card]. Customer is responsible for providing complete and accurate billing and contact information to Provider and notifying Provider of any changes to such information.\n\n**13.4. Price Adjustments and Escalations.** \n*   **(a) Annual Escalation:** On each anniversary of the Effective Date, Provider reserves the right to increase the Fees for the subsequent Renewal Term by an amount not to exceed [e.g., five percent (5%)] or the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for All Urban Consumers as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the preceding twelve-month period, whichever is greater.\n*   **(b) Market Adjustments:** Notwithstanding Section 13.4(a), Provider may adjust pricing for any Renewal Term by providing Customer with written notice of such price increase at least sixty (60) days prior to the end of the then-current Term. \n*   **(c) Modification of Services:** Should Customer request a change in the scope, volume, or nature of the Services, Provider shall issue a revised Order Form or SOW reflecting the adjusted pricing, which shall become effective upon mutual execution.\n\n**13.5. Late Payments and Collection.** Any Fees not received by the Due Date shall accrue interest at the rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month, or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, from the date such payment was due until the date paid. Customer shall be liable for all costs of collection, including reasonable attorneys\' fees and court costs, incurred by Provider in recovering delinquent payments.\n\n**13.6. Suspension of Service for Non-Payment.** If any amount owing by Customer under this or any other agreement for Services is thirty (30) days or more overdue, Provider may, without limiting its other rights and remedies, accelerate Customer’s unpaid fee obligations so that all such obligations become immediately due and payable, and suspend Services until such amounts are paid in full. Provider will provide at least seven (7) days’ prior notice that Customer’s account is overdue before suspending services.\n\n**13.7. Billing Disputes.** Customer must notify Provider in writing of any good faith dispute regarding an invoice within fifteen (15) days of the invoice date, providing specific details of the discrepancy. Customer shall pay all undisputed portions of the invoice by the Due Date. The parties shall work diligently and in good faith to resolve the dispute. Upon resolution, any agreed-upon adjustments shall be reflected in the next billing cycle. Customer waives all rights to dispute charges not reported within the aforementioned fifteen (15) day period.\n\n**13.8. Taxes.** Fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties, or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, but not limited to, value-added, sales, use, or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction whatsoever (collectively, “Taxes”). Customer is responsible for paying all Taxes associated with its purchases hereunder. If Provider has the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which Customer is responsible under this section, Provider will invoice Customer and Customer will pay that amount unless Customer provides Provider with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority.\n\n**13.9.

## 14. Invoicing and Payment Terms

[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'This is a dense, professionally drafted legal provision for a commercial agreement. It is designed to be rigorous, protecting the service provider/vendor while clearly outlining the obligations of the client.\n\n***\n\n### 14. Invoicing and Payment Terms\n\n**14.1. Fees and Compensation.** In consideration for the Services provided by the Provider pursuant to this Agreement, the Client shall pay all fees, charges, and expenses (the “Fees”) as specified in the applicable Statement of Work (SOW) or Purchase Order. Unless otherwise expressly stated, all Fees are quoted and shall be paid in [Currency, e.g., United States Dollars (USD)].\n\n**14.2. Invoicing Schedule and Delivery.** The Provider shall issue invoices to the Client [e.g., monthly in arrears / in accordance with the milestones set forth in the SOW]. Each invoice shall be delivered electronically to the Client’s designated billing contact and shall include, at a minimum: (i) the Provider’s name and remittance address; (ii) a unique invoice number; (iii) the period covered; (iv) a detailed breakdown of the Services rendered or milestones achieved; and (v) any reimbursable expenses incurred in accordance with Section 14.8.\n\n**14.3. Payment Terms.** Subject to Section 14.5 (Disputed Invoices), the Client shall pay all undisputed amounts in full within [e.g., thirty (30) days] from the date of receipt of the invoice (the “Due Date”). Payment shall be made via [e.g., electronic funds transfer (EFT), Automated Clearing House (ACH), or wire transfer] to the bank account designated by the Provider. All transaction or processing fees, including intermediary bank fees for international transfers, shall be borne solely by the Client.\n\n**14.4. Taxes.** All Fees are exclusive of any applicable sales, use, value-added (VAT), excise, withholding, or other taxes, duties, or governmental assessments of any nature (“Taxes”). The Client is responsible for paying all Taxes associated with its purchases hereunder, excluding taxes based on the Provider’s net income or property. If the Provider has a legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which the Client is responsible under this section, the Provider will invoice the Client and the Client shall pay that amount unless the Client provides the Provider with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority.\n\n**14.5. Payment Disputes.** If the Client disputes any portion of an invoice in good faith, the Client must: (i) pay the undisputed portion of the invoice by the Due Date; and (ii) provide the Provider with a written notice of dispute, detailing the specific items and the grounds for the dispute, within [e.g., ten (10) business days] of the invoice date. Failure to provide such notice within the specified timeframe shall constitute a waiver of the Client’s right to dispute the invoice. The parties shall act in good faith to resolve the dispute expeditiously.\n\n**14.6. Late Payments and Interest.** Any undisputed amount not paid by the Due Date shall accrue interest from the Due Date until the date of actual payment at a rate equal to the lesser of: (i) one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month; or (ii) the maximum rate permitted by applicable law. The Client shall reimburse the Provider for all reasonable costs incurred in collecting any late payments or interest, including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees, court costs, and collection agency fees.\n\n**14.7. Suspension of Service and Acceleration.** If any amount owing by the Client under this or any other agreement for the Services is [e.g., fifteen (15) or more days] overdue, the Provider may, without limiting its other rights and remedies: (i) accelerate the Client’s unpaid fee obligations under such agreements so that all such obligations become immediately due and payable; and (ii) suspend the provision of Services until such amounts are paid in full. The Provider will provide at least [e.g., seven (7) days’] prior notice that the Client’s account is overdue before suspending services.\n\n**14.8. Reimbursable Expenses.** The Client shall reimburse the Provider for all reasonable, documented, out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Provider in connection with the performance of the Services, provided that such expenses have received prior written approval from the Client. Reimbursable expenses shall be invoiced at cost, with no markup, and shall be subject to the same payment terms as Fees.\n\n**14.9. No Set-Off.** The Client shall pay all amounts due under this Agreement in full without any set-off, counterclaim, deduction, or withholding (except for any deduction or withholding of tax as required by law). The Client’s obligation to pay the Fees is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including any claim for breach of contract by the Provider.\n\n**14.10. Audit Rights.** Upon reasonable prior notice and during regular business hours, the Client (or an independent third-party auditor) may audit the Provider’s records directly related to the billing of Services and expenses to ensure compliance with this Agreement. Any such audit shall be conducted no more than once per calendar year and at the Client’s sole expense. If an audit reveals an overcharge, the Provider shall credit the Client the amount of the overcharge on the next invoice.', 'extras': {'signature': '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'}}]

## 15. Taxes, Duties, and Withholding

[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'This is a dense, "pro-provider" style legal clause typically found in Master Service Agreements (MSAs), International Sales Contracts, or SaaS Agreements. It is designed to shift tax liability and administrative burdens to the Customer while protecting the Provider from cross-border withholding risks.\n\n***\n\n### 15. Taxes, Duties, and Withholding\n\n**15.1 Net of Taxes.** All Fees, rates, and other amounts payable by the Customer to the Provider under this Agreement are stated exclusive of all applicable taxes, levies, assessments, duties, or similar governmental impositions of any nature. The Customer shall be solely responsible for the payment of all sales, use, value-added (VAT), goods and services (GST), consumption, excise, service, business, environmental, and other similar taxes, as well as any applicable customs duties, import/export fees, or tariffs (collectively, "Taxes") imposed by any local, state, provincial, federal, or foreign taxing authority, arising out of or in connection with the execution of this Agreement or the delivery of the Services, excluding only those taxes based solely on the Provider’s net income, franchise, or property.\n\n**15.2 Payment and Remittance.** If the Provider is legally obligated to collect and remit Taxes for which the Customer is responsible under this Section 15, the Provider shall invoice the Customer for such Taxes as a separate line item. The Customer shall pay such invoiced Taxes in full without set-off or deduction. In the event that the Customer is required by law to remit Taxes directly to a taxing authority (e.g., under a "reverse charge" mechanism), the Customer shall provide the Provider with written evidence of such payment within thirty (30) days of the date of payment.\n\n**15.3 Tax Withholding and Gross-Up.** All payments made by the Customer to the Provider shall be made free and clear of, and without reduction for, any withholding taxes. If any applicable law requires the Customer to deduct or withhold any tax from any payment due to the Provider, then the Customer shall: (a) notify the Provider in writing of such requirement immediately upon becoming aware of it; (b) pay the required amount to the relevant taxing authority in a timely manner; (c) provide the Provider with official tax receipts or other evidence of payment sufficient to enable the Provider to claim a foreign tax credit; and (d) increase the amount of the payment to the Provider (a "Gross-Up") such that, after all required deductions and withholdings have been made (including any withholdings applicable to the additional sums payable under this Section), the Provider receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been required.\n\n**15.4 Tax Exemptions.** If the Customer claims an exemption from any Taxes, it must provide the Provider with a valid, legally sufficient tax exemption certificate or other documentation acceptable to the relevant taxing authority prior to the issuance of any invoice. The Provider shall be entitled to rely on such documentation without independent verification. The Customer shall indemnify and hold the Provider harmless from and against any Taxes, interest, or penalties resulting from the Provider\'s reliance on an invalid or inapplicable exemption certificate provided by the Customer.\n\n**15.5 Cooperation and Audits.** The parties agree to cooperate in good faith to minimize the impact of any Taxes to the extent legally permissible, including the timely provision of Value Added Tax (VAT) or Goods and Services Tax (GST) identification numbers and information regarding the location of the use of Services. In the event of a tax audit or inquiry by any governmental authority related to the Services provided hereunder, the Customer shall provide all reasonable assistance and documentation necessary for the Provider to respond to such audit or inquiry.\n\n**15.6 Survival of Obligation.** The Customer’s obligations under this Section 15 shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement. Any deficiency in the payment of Taxes for which the Customer is responsible, including any interest, penalties, or additions thereto, whether assessed during the term of this Agreement or thereafter, shall be the sole liability of the Customer, and the Customer shall indemnify the Provider for any such costs incurred as a result of the Customer’s failure to comply with its tax obligations herein.\n\n***\n\n### Key Legal Concepts Addressed:\n*   **Exclusivity of Fees:** Establishes that the base price is for the service only and does not include government "takes."\n*   **The "Gross-Up" Provision:** This is critical in international law. It ensures that if a foreign government takes 10% of a payment at the border, the Customer must pay the Provider 111.1% of the invoice so the Provider still nets 100%.\n*   **Reverse Charge Mechanism:** Accounts for jurisdictions where the buyer is responsible for self-assessing VAT.\n*   **Indemnification:** Protects the Provider if the Customer provides a fake or expired tax-exempt certificate.\n*   **Survival:** Ensures that if the tax man comes knocking three years after the contract ends, the Customer is still on the hook for those unpaid taxes.', 'extras': {'signature': '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'}}]

## 16. Late Payments and Disputes

[{'type': 'text', 'text': "This text is drafted in a high-density, professional legal style suitable for a Master Service Agreement (MSA), SaaS Agreement, or Enterprise Commercial Contract.\n\n***\n\n**16. LATE PAYMENTS AND DISPUTES**\n\n**16.1. Interest on Overdue Obligations.** Any undisputed sum not received by the Provider by the applicable Due Date shall be deemed delinquent and shall, at the Provider’s sole discretion, accrue interest from the date such payment was due until the date paid in full. Such interest shall be calculated at a rate equal to the lesser of: (a) one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month; or (b) the maximum rate permitted by applicable law (the “Default Rate”). Interest shall accrue on a daily basis and shall be compounded monthly, both before and after any judgment is obtained. The imposition of such interest shall be without prejudice to any other rights or remedies available to the Provider under this Agreement, at law, or in equity.\n\n**16.2. Suspension of Service for Non-Payment.** If any undisputed amount remains unpaid for more than fifteen (15) calendar days following the Due Date, the Provider reserves the unilateral right, following five (5) days' written notice of its intent to suspend, to: (i) suspend the Client’s access to the Services; (ii) cease all performance of ongoing professional services; and (iii) withhold any deliverables, work product, or licenses otherwise due to the Client. Any such suspension shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement, nor shall it relieve the Client of its obligation to pay all accrued Fees, including interest and any applicable reinstatement fees. The Provider shall have no liability for any damages, losses, or costs incurred by the Client resulting from a suspension of services pursuant to this Section 16.2.\n\n**16.3. Billing Disputes.** If the Client, in good faith, disputes any portion of an invoice (a “Disputed Amount”), the Client must notify the Provider in writing of the specific nature and basis of the dispute within ten (10) business days of the invoice date (the “Dispute Period”). To be valid, such notice must include reasonable supporting documentation. Failure to provide such notice within the Dispute Period shall constitute a final and irrevocable waiver of the Client’s right to dispute the invoice, and the invoice shall be deemed accepted and owed in full.\n\n**16.4. Resolution of Disputes.** In the event of a timely and validly noticed Billing Dispute:\n   *   (a) The Client shall punctually pay all undisputed portions of the invoice by the original Due Date.\n   *   (b) The parties shall engage in good-faith negotiations to resolve the Disputed Amount for a period of no less than twenty (20) business days following the Provider’s receipt of the dispute notice.\n   *   (c) If the parties determine that a Disputed Amount was billed in error, the Provider shall issue a credit note or revised invoice.\n   *   (d) If the dispute is resolved in favor of the Provider, the Client shall pay the Disputed Amount, plus interest at the Default Rate calculated from the original Due Date, within five (5) business days of such resolution.\n\n**16.5. No Set-off.** All payments due under this Agreement shall be made in full without any set-off, counterclaim, deduction, or withholding of any kind (including deductions for taxes, bank fees, or currency fluctuations), unless required by applicable law, in which case the Client shall ensure the net amount received by the Provider, after such withholding or deduction, shall be equal to the full amount that would have been received had no such deduction or withholding been required.\n\n**16.6. Collection Costs.** The Client shall be liable for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Provider in connection with the collection of any delinquent amounts or the enforcement of its rights under this Section 16, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees, court costs, and the fees of third-party collection agencies.\n\n**16.7. Acceleration.** Upon the occurrence of a payment default that remains uncured for thirty (30) days, the Provider may, at its option, declare all remaining unpaid Fees for the remainder of the then-current Term immediately due and payable, and may require the Client to provide a form of security or advance payment as a condition of continued service.", 'extras': {'signature': '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'}}]

## 18. Customer Data Ownership and Licensing

[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'This text is drafted as a robust, enterprise-grade legal provision suitable for a Master Service Agreement (MSA), Terms of Service (ToS), or SaaS Agreement. It is designed to protect the provider while offering the transparency and ownership assurances typically required by sophisticated corporate customers.\n\n***\n\n### 18. CUSTOMER DATA OWNERSHIP AND LICENSING\n\n**18.1 Ownership of Customer Data.** As between the Provider and the Customer, the Customer shall retain all right, title, and interest (including, without limitation, all intellectual property, proprietary, and moral rights) in and to all data, information, files, text, images, or other content uploaded, transmitted, submitted, or otherwise processed by the Customer or its Authorized Users through the Services (collectively, "Customer Data"). No ownership rights in the Customer Data are transferred to the Provider under this Agreement, and the Provider shall not use Customer Data except as expressly permitted herein or as required by applicable law.\n\n**18.2 License Grant to Provider.** For the duration of the Subscription Term, the Customer hereby grants to the Provider a non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, sub-licensable (through multiple tiers of sub-processors and service providers), and transferable license to host, copy, transmit, record, store, cache, display, modify, and process the Customer Data solely for the following purposes: (a) providing, maintaining, and updating the Services as contemplated by this Agreement; (b) preventing or addressing service, support, or technical issues; (c) complying with the law or a valid legal order; and (d) as otherwise expressly authorized by the Customer in writing. This license shall terminate automatically upon the expiration or termination of this Agreement, subject to the Provider’s post-termination data retention and transition obligations as set forth in Section 18.5.\n\n**18.3 Usage Data and Aggregated/De-identified Data.** Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 18.1, the Customer acknowledges and agrees that the Provider shall have the right to collect, extract, compile, and analyze metadata and usage statistics derived from the Customer’s use of the Services (“Usage Data”). Furthermore, the Provider may aggregate Customer Data with data from other customers or de-identify Customer Data such that it does not identify the Customer or any natural person (“Aggregated Data”). The Provider shall own all right, title, and interest in such Usage Data and Aggregated Data. The Provider may use such data for any lawful purpose, including but not limited to: (i) improving, benchmarking, and enhancing the Services; (ii) developing new products and features; and (iii) generating industry reports or research; provided, however, that the Provider shall never disclose Aggregated Data to a third party in a manner that identifies the Customer or its Authorized Users as the source of such data.\n\n**18.4 Customer Representations and Warranties.** The Customer represents, warrants, and covenants that: (a) it possesses all necessary rights, licenses, consents, and permissions to provide the Customer Data to the Provider and to grant the licenses set forth in Section 18.2; (b) the Customer Data and the Provider’s use thereof in accordance with this Agreement will not infringe, misappropriate, or violate the intellectual property rights, privacy rights, or publicity rights of any third party; and (c) the Customer Data does not contain any material that is unlawful, harmful, or in violation of the Provider’s Acceptable Use Policy. The Customer shall have sole responsibility for the accuracy, quality, integrity, legality, reliability, and appropriateness of all Customer Data.\n\n**18.5 Extraction and Deletion.** Upon written request by the Customer made within thirty (30) days following the effective date of termination or expiration of this Agreement, the Provider shall provide the Customer with a reasonable opportunity to export or retrieve the Customer Data in a standard, industry-recognized format. Following such thirty (30) day period, the Provider shall have no obligation to maintain or provide any Customer Data and shall, unless legally prohibited or otherwise required for business continuity and disaster recovery purposes (in which case the data shall remain encrypted and protected in accordance with the Provider’s security policies), delete all copies of Customer Data from its production systems.\n\n**18.6 Data Processing and Security.** The parties acknowledge that Customer Data may include "Personal Data" or "Personally Identifiable Information" as defined under applicable data protection laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA). The processing of such data is governed by the Data Processing Addendum (“DPA”), which is hereby incorporated into this Agreement by reference. The Provider shall maintain a comprehensive information security program including administrative, physical, and technical safeguards designed to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of Customer Data against unauthorized access, disclosure, or destruction.\n\n**18.7 Responsibility for Backups.** Unless otherwise explicitly stated in an executed Statement of Work or Service Level Agreement (SLA), the Customer is solely responsible for maintaining its own independent backups of all Customer Data. While the Provider employs robust disaster recovery protocols, the Provider does not guarantee against the loss of data and shall not be liable for any such loss arising from the Customer’s failure to maintain independent backups.', 'extras': {'signature': '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'}}]

[{'type': 'text', 'text': '**19. USAGE DATA AND AGGREGATED STATISTICS**\n\n**19.1 Definition of Usage Data.** Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any associated Privacy Policy, "Usage Data" shall mean any and all information, data, metadata, and insights collected, derived, or generated by the Company’s systems, platforms, or applications (the "Service") relating to the User’s access, interaction, performance, and utilization of the Service. Usage Data includes, but is not limited to, telemetry data, system logs, clickstream patterns, feature utilization rates, session durations, error reports, hardware and software configurations, IP addresses (subject to anonymization protocols), and other functional metrics associated with the User’s environment and interaction with the Service.\n\n**19.2 Right to Collect and Process.** User acknowledges and agrees that Company shall have the right to monitor, collect, extract, and process Usage Data in the ordinary course of providing the Service. This collection is performed to facilitate the delivery of the Service, ensure operational security, provide technical support, and verify compliance with the terms of this Agreement. The User hereby grants the Company a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use, copy, modify, and analyze Usage Data for the Company’s internal business purposes, including but not limited to the enhancement of machine learning models, infrastructure optimization, and product development.\n\n**19.3 Generation of Aggregated Statistics.** Company shall have the right to compile, synthesize, and analyze Usage Data and User-provided data to create "Aggregated Statistics." Aggregated Statistics consist of data that has been combined, processed, or de-identified in such a manner that the resulting data set does not identify the User, any individual natural person, or any specific Confidential Information of the User. For the avoidance of doubt, Aggregated Statistics shall be rendered anonymous and shall not be capable of being re-identified or reverse-engineered to reveal the identity of the User or its End Users.\n\n**19.4 Ownership and Intellectual Property.** As between the Company and the User, all right, title, and interest in and to the Aggregated Statistics, including all associated intellectual property rights, shall be owned exclusively by the Company. To the extent that the User is deemed to have any ownership interest in the Aggregated Statistics, the User hereby irrevocably assigns, transfers, and conveys to the Company all such right, title, and interest therein.

## 21. Confidential Information and Non-Disclosure

[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'This is a comprehensive, "pro-discloser" legal clause suitable for a Master Services Agreement (MSA), Employment Contract, or high-stakes Partnership Agreement. It is designed to be dense, restrictive, and protective of proprietary interests.\n\n***\n\n### 21. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND NON-DISCLOSURE\n\n**21.1 Definition of Confidential Information.** For the purposes of this Agreement, “Confidential Information” shall mean any and all non-public, proprietary, or sensitive information, whether or not marked as “confidential” or “proprietary,” disclosed by one party (the “Disclosing Party”) to the other party (the “Receiving Party”), whether orally, in writing, or by inspection of tangible objects, and whether disclosed before or after the Effective Date. Confidential Information includes, without limitation: (a) technical data, trade secrets, know-how, formulae, designs, concepts, schematics, drawings, algorithms, software code (source and object), and research and development materials; (b) business plans, marketing strategies, customer lists, vendor lists, pricing policies, financial statements, and projections; (c) any information regarding the Disclosing Party’s employees, contractors, or internal organizational structure; and (d) the existence and specific terms and conditions of this Agreement.\n\n**21.2 Exclusions.** Confidential Information shall not include information that the Receiving Party can demonstrate by written documentation: (a) was already known to the Receiving Party without restriction at the time of disclosure; (b) is or becomes generally available to the public through no fault or breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party; (c) is rightfully received by the Receiving Party from a third party who is not under a duty of confidentiality; or (d) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.\n\n**21.3 Obligations of Non-Use and Non-Disclosure.** The Receiving Party shall: (a) maintain the Confidential Information in strict confidence and take all reasonable precautions to prevent its unauthorized dissemination, using at least the same degree of care as it uses to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature, but in no event less than a reasonable standard of care; (b) use the Confidential Information solely for the purpose of exercising its rights and performing its obligations under this Agreement (the “Purpose”); and (c) not disclose, divulge, or otherwise communicate any Confidential Information to any third party, except to its employees, legal counsel, or financial advisors (collectively, “Representatives”) who have a legitimate “need to know” such information for the Purpose and who are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those contained herein. The Receiving Party shall be liable for any breach of this Section 21 by its Representatives.\n\n**21.4 Compelled Disclosure.** If the Receiving Party is required by law, regulation, or a valid order of a court or other governmental body to disclose Confidential Information, the Receiving Party shall, to the extent legally permitted: (a) provide the Disclosing Party with prompt written notice of such requirement so that the Disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy; (b) limit the disclosure to only that portion of the Confidential Information which is legally required; and (c) exercise reasonable efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to the information so disclosed.\n\n**21.5 Return or Destruction of Materials.** Upon the Disclosing Party’s written request, or upon the expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason, the Receiving Party shall promptly, and at the Disclosing Party’s option, either return all originals and copies of Confidential Information in its possession or control, or destroy the same and certify such destruction in writing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party may retain: (i) such copies of Confidential Information as are required to be maintained by law or regulation; and (ii) Confidential Information contained in archived computer system backups, provided that such retained information shall remain subject to the confidentiality obligations of this Agreement until such time as it is destroyed in the ordinary course of business.\n\n**21.6 Ownership and No License.** All Confidential Information remains the sole and exclusive property of the Disclosing Party. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any rights, by license or otherwise, to any Confidential Information, or to any invention, patent, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property right of the Disclosing Party.\n\n**21.7 Remedies and Equitable Relief.** The Receiving Party acknowledges that any breach or threatened breach of this Section 21 may cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party for which monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy. Accordingly, in the event of such a breach or threatened breach, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek, in addition to any other available remedies at law or in equity, immediate injunctive relief and specific performance, without the necessity of posting a bond or proving actual damages.\n\n**21.8 Survival.** The obligations of confidentiality, non-use, and non-disclosure set forth in this Section 21 shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement for a period of five (5) years; provided, however, that with respect to any Confidential Information that constitutes a trade secret under applicable law, such obligations shall survive for as long as such information remains a trade secret.\n\n***\n\n### Key Legal Elements included:\n*   **Breadth of Scope:** Covers both tangible and intangible data, as well as the existence of the contract itself.\n*   **Standard of Care:** Establishes the "reasonable care" threshold while tethering it to the party\'s own internal standards.\n*   **Compelled Disclosure Protections:** Provides a "notice-and-cooperate" workflow for subpoenas.\n*   **Safe Harbor for Backups:** Recognizes the reality of modern IT (archived digital backups) while maintaining the duty to protect them.\n*   **Equitable Relief:** Explicitly mentions "irreparable harm" to make it easier to get a court-ordered injunction if secrets are leaked.\n*   **Trade Secret Extension:** Ensures that while general secrets expire (e.g., 5 years), core trade secrets are protected in perpetuity.', 'extras': {'signature': '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'}}]

## 22. Exceptions to Confidentiality

[{'type': 'text', 'text': '**22. EXCEPTIONS TO CONFIDENTIALITY**\n\n**22.1. General Exclusions.** Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the obligations of confidentiality, non-use, and non-disclosure set forth herein shall not apply to any information, data, or materials for which the Receiving Party can demonstrate, through competent contemporaneous written evidence, that such information:\n(a) was already in the public domain at the time of its disclosure by the Disclosing Party or subsequently becomes part of the public domain through no fault, act, or omission of the Receiving Party, its Affiliates, or their respective Representatives in violation of this Agreement;\n(b) was rightfully in the Receiving Party’s possession, free of any obligation of confidence, prior to the time of disclosure by the Disclosing Party;\n(c) was lawfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party who, to the Receiving Party’s knowledge after reasonable inquiry, was not under an obligation of confidentiality to the Disclosing Party and had the legal right to disclose such information; or\n(d) was independently developed by the Receiving Party or its Affiliates without the use of, reference to, or reliance upon the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information, as evidenced by the Receiving Party’s internal records maintained in the ordinary course of business.\n\n**22.2. Compelled Disclosure.** \n(a) **Legal Process:** The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to the extent required by a valid order of a court of competent jurisdiction, a government agency, or other applicable legal, administrative, or regulatory process (a “Legal Requirement”). \n(b) **Notice and Cooperation:** In the event the Receiving Party is subject to a Legal Requirement to disclose Confidential Information, the Receiving Party shall, to the extent legally permissible: (i) provide the Disclosing Party with prompt written notice of such requirement so that the Disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy; (ii) reasonably cooperate with the Disclosing Party, at the Disclosing Party’s sole expense, in opposing such disclosure or seeking a protective order; and (iii) only disclose that portion of the Confidential Information that it is legally compelled to disclose based on the advice of its legal counsel.\n(c) **Protective Treatment:** If, in the absence of a protective order, the Receiving Party is nonetheless legally compelled to disclose Confidential Information, the Receiving Party shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to the disclosed information.\n\n**22.3. Permitted Disclosures to Representatives.** The Receiving Party may disclose the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information to its and its Affiliates’ directors, officers, employees, legal counsel, accountants, and financial advisors (collectively, “Representatives”) strictly on a “need-to-know” basis for the purposes of performing its obligations or exercising its rights under this Agreement. The Receiving Party shall: (a) ensure that all such Representatives are informed of the confidential nature of the information; (b) ensure that such Representatives are bound by written confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those contained herein; and (c) remain primarily liable for any breach of this Agreement caused by the acts or omissions of its Representatives.\n\n**22.4. Statutory Immunity (U.S. Defend Trade Secrets Act).** Pursuant to the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016 (18 U.S.C. § 1833(b)), the Receiving Party is hereby notified that an individual shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any Federal or State trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that: (a) is made (i) in confidence to a Federal, State, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (b) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. \n\n**22.5. Burden of Proof.** The burden of proving the applicability of any exception set forth in this Section 22 shall rest entirely upon the Receiving Party. No Confidential Information shall be deemed to be within the foregoing exceptions merely because it is embraced by more general information within the exceptions, nor shall a combination of features be deemed within the exceptions unless the combination itself and its entire principle of operation are within the exceptions.\n\n**22.6. Residuals.** Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to limit the Receiving Party’s right to use for any purpose the "residuals" resulting from access to or work with the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information, provided that the Receiving Party does not disclose the Confidential Information except as permitted herein. The term “residuals” means information in non-tangible form which may be retained in the unaided memory of persons who have had access to the Confidential Information, including ideas, concepts, know-how, or techniques contained therein, so long as such persons have not intentionally memorized the Confidential Information for the purpose of circumventing the restrictions of this Agreement. This Section 22.6 does not grant the Receiving Party any license under any patents or copyrights of the Disclosing Party.', 'extras': {'signature': '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'}}]

## 23. Data Protection and Privacy Compliance (DPA)

[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'This text is drafted as a robust, enterprise-grade legal clause suitable for a Master Service Agreement (MSA), SaaS Agreement, or complex Data Processing Agreement. It is designed to be "dense and detailed" as requested, covering multiple jurisdictions (GDPR, UK GDPR, CCPA/CPRA) and standard commercial protections.\n\n***\n\n### 23. Data Protection and Privacy Compliance (DPA)\n\n**23.1 Definitions and Scope.** For the purposes of this Section 23, the terms “Personal Data,” “Data Subject,” “Processing,” “Controller,” “Processor,” and “Personal Data Breach” shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”) or other applicable Data Protection Laws. “Data Protection Laws” shall mean all applicable global laws and regulations relating to the processing of personal data and privacy, including but not limited to the GDPR, the UK GDPR, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020) (“CCPA”), and any other local, state, or federal privacy statutes enacted in the jurisdictions where the Parties operate.\n\n**23.2 Roles of the Parties.** The Parties acknowledge and agree that with respect to the Processing of Personal Data provided by the Customer (the “Controller”) to the Provider (the “Processor”) in connection with the Services, the Provider acts as a Processor (or “Service Provider” as defined under the CCPA). The scope, nature, and purpose of the Processing, the types of Personal Data, and the categories of Data Subjects are set forth in the [Data Processing Addendum/Schedule] attached hereto, which is incorporated by reference.\n\n**23.3 Compliance Obligations.** The Processor represents and warrants that it shall:\n(a) Process Personal Data only on documented instructions from the Controller, including with regard to transfers of Personal Data to a third country or an international organization, unless required to do so by applicable law;\n(b) Ensure that persons authorized to Process the Personal Data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality;\n(c) Implement and maintain rigorous technical and organizational measures (“TOMs”) to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including, as appropriate, the pseudonymization and encryption of data, the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems, and a process for regularly testing, assessing, and evaluating the effectiveness of such measures;\n(d) Assist the Controller, taking into account the nature of the Processing, by appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as this is possible, for the fulfillment of the Controller’s obligation to respond to requests for exercising the Data Subject\'s rights;\n(e) Assist the Controller in ensuring compliance with the obligations pursuant to Articles 32 to 36 of the GDPR (Security, Breach Notification, DPIA, and Prior Consultation) taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the Processor.\n\n**23.4 Sub-processing.** The Processor shall not engage another processor (a “Sub-processor”) without prior specific or general written authorization of the Controller. In the case of general written authorization, the Processor shall inform the Controller of any intended changes concerning the addition or replacement of Sub-processors, thereby giving the Controller the opportunity to object to such changes. The Processor shall impose the same data protection obligations as set out in this Section 23 on any Sub-processor by way of a written contract, and the Processor shall remain fully liable to the Controller for the performance of that Sub-processor\'s obligations.\n\n**23.5 International Data Transfers.** To the extent that the Processing of Personal Data involves a transfer from the European Economic Area (EEA), Switzerland, or the United Kingdom to a country that has not been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection by the relevant regulatory authorities, the Parties agree to rely on the standard contractual clauses (SCCs) approved by the European Commission or the UK International Data Transfer Addendum (IDTA), as applicable. Such clauses shall be deemed incorporated herein by reference and shall prevail in the event of a conflict with this Agreement.\n\n**23.6 Data Breach Notification.** The Processor shall notify the Controller without undue delay (and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours) after becoming aware of a Personal Data Breach. Such notification shall include, at a minimum: (i) the nature of the breach; (ii) the categories and approximate number of Data Subjects and records concerned; (iii) the name and contact details of the Data Protection Officer or other contact point; and (iv) the measures taken or proposed to be taken to mitigate the effects of the breach.\n\n**23.7 Audit Rights and Inspection.** The Processor shall make available to the Controller all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations laid down in this Section 23 and allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections, conducted by the Controller or another auditor mandated by the Controller. Any such audit shall be conducted during normal business hours, subject to reasonable prior notice, and shall not occur more than once per calendar year, except in the event of a suspected or actual Personal Data Breach.\n\n**23.8 Termination and Data Return.** Upon the termination or expiration of this Agreement, or at any time upon the Controller’s written request, the Processor shall, at the choice of the Controller, delete or return all Personal Data to the Controller and delete existing copies unless applicable law requires the storage of the Personal Data.\n\n**23.9 CCPA Specific Provisions.** To the extent the CCPA applies, the Processor certifies that it understands and will comply with the restrictions on “selling” or “sharing” Personal Information and will not retain, use, or disclose Personal Information for any purpose other than for the specific purpose of performing the Services specified in this Agreement, or as otherwise permitted by the CCPA. The Processor shall notify the Controller if it makes a determination that it can no longer meet its obligations under the CCPA.\n\n**23.10 Conflict of Terms.** In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the terms of this Section 23 and the main body of this Agreement, the terms of this Section 23 shall prevail.

## 24. Information Security and Security Measures

[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'This text is designed for a **Master Services Agreement (MSA)**, **SaaS Terms of Service**, or a **Data Processing Agreement (DPA)**. It utilizes high-level legal and technical terminology to ensure maximum protection and clarity regarding the responsibilities of a Service Provider.\n\n***\n\n### 24. Information Security and Security Measures\n\n**24.1 Technical and Organizational Measures.** The Provider represents and warrants that it has implemented, and shall maintain throughout the Term, a comprehensive written information security program (“WISP”) that complies with applicable Data Protection Laws and industry standards (e.g., ISO/IEC 27001, SOC 2 Type II, or NIST CSF). Such program shall include formal policies, procedures, and rigorous technical and organizational measures (“TOMs”) designed to: (a) ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability, and resilience of processing systems and services; (b) protect against unauthorized or unlawful access, accidental loss, destruction, damage, or disclosure of Customer Data; and (c) identify and mitigate foreseeable internal and external risks to the security of the Provider’s network and information systems.\n\n**24.2 Access Control and Authentication.** Provider shall strictly limit access to Customer Data to those personnel who have a legitimate "need-to-know" for the performance of the Services. Provider shall maintain robust identity and access management (IAM) protocols, including, but not limited to: (i) the principle of least privilege (PoLP); (ii) the use of multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all remote and administrative access; (iii) immediate revocation of access credentials upon employee termination or change in role; and (iv) periodic reviews of access rights.\n\n**24.3 Encryption and Data Protection.** Provider shall employ industry-standard cryptographic protocols to protect Customer Data. All data shall be encrypted: (a) while in transit over public or untrusted networks using Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2 or higher; and (b) while at rest using AES-256 or an equivalent strong encryption standard. Provider shall maintain secure key management practices to prevent unauthorized decryption or exposure of cryptographic materials.\n\n**24.4 Vulnerability Management and Network Security.** Provider shall maintain a secure network architecture including the use of stateful firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and logical segmentation of production environments from development and testing environments. Provider shall perform: (i) continuous automated vulnerability scanning; (ii) quarterly internal and external penetration testing conducted by independent, qualified third-party security professionals; and (iii) timely remediation of discovered vulnerabilities in accordance with Provider’s patch management policy, prioritized by CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) severity.\n\n**24.5 Security Incident Response.** Provider shall maintain a formal Incident Response Plan (“IRP”) to be invoked in the event of a suspected or actual Security Incident. A “Security Incident” is defined as any unauthorized access, acquisition, disclosure, or accidental destruction of Customer Data. In the event of a Security Incident, Provider shall: (a) notify the Customer without undue delay and, in any event, within forty-eight (48) hours of discovery; (b) take immediate steps to mitigate the effects and prevent further unauthorized activity; and (c) provide the Customer with a detailed report encompassing the nature of the breach, the volume of data impacted, and the remediation steps taken.\n\n**24.6 Audit Rights and Compliance Documentation.** Upon written request, and no more than once per calendar year, Provider shall provide Customer with executive summaries of its most recent independent security audit reports (e.g., SOC 2 Type II or ISO 27001 certification). If Customer has a reasonable basis to believe Provider is in material breach of its security obligations, and the provided reports are insufficient to verify compliance, Provider shall allow Customer (or a mutually agreed-upon independent third-party auditor) to conduct a targeted security assessment of Provider’s environment, subject to strict confidentiality obligations and at Customer’s sole expense.\n\n**24.7 Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery.** Provider shall maintain and regularly test a Business Continuity Plan (“BCP”) and a Disaster Recovery Plan (“DRP”) designed to minimize service disruptions. This shall include, at minimum: (i) geographically redundant data backups performed at least daily; (ii) documented Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO); and (iii) regular integrity testing of backup restoration processes to ensure data can be recovered within the specified timeframes.\n\n**24.8 Personnel Security and Training.** Provider shall ensure that all employees and contractors with access to Customer Data are subject to: (a) comprehensive background checks (to the extent permitted by local law); (b) binding confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements that survive the termination of employment; and (c) mandatory annual security awareness training, including specialized training on phishing, social engineering, and secure coding practices for development personnel.\n\n**24.9 Disposal of Data.** Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, or upon Customer’s written request, Provider shall, at Customer’s election, either return or securely delete all Customer Data in its possession or control. Deletion shall be performed in accordance with NIST 800-88 (Guidelines for Media Sanitization) or an equivalent standard, ensuring that data is rendered unrecoverable. Provider shall, upon request, provide a written certification of such destruction.\n\n**24.10 Sub-processor Security.** To the extent that Provider engages sub-processors to process Customer Data, Provider shall ensure that such sub-processors are bound by written agreements providing a level of data protection no less protective than those set forth in this Section 24. Provider shall remain fully liable for the acts and omissions of its sub-processors regarding the security of Customer Data.\n\n***\n\n### Key Legal Phrases used:\n*   **"Without undue delay":** A standard timeframe in GDPR and other privacy laws that is more flexible than a hard hour-count but implies urgency.\n*   **"Commercially reasonable":** Limits the provider\'s liability to what is standard and feasible in the industry.\n*   **"Principle of Least Privilege":** A technical security standard often required for compliance audits.\n*   **"Sanitization":** The legal/technical term for making data permanently unrecoverable.\n*   **"Indemnification/Liability":** Usually handled in a separate section, but Section 24.10 links sub-processor failure back to the primary Provider.', 'extras': {'signature': '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'}}]

## 25. Security Incident Notification and Remediation

[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'This is a dense, legally rigorous draft for **Section 25. Security Incident Notification and Remediation**. It is designed for use in a Master Service Agreement (MSA), Data Processing Addendum (DPA), or high-level SaaS Agreement.\n\n***\n\n### 25. Security Incident Notification and Remediation\n\n**25.1 Definition of Security Incident.** For the purposes of this Agreement, a “Security Incident” shall mean any confirmed or reasonably suspected accidental, unauthorized, or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, disclosure of, or access to, Customer Data or Personal Data (as defined by Applicable Law) transmitted, stored, or otherwise processed by the Provider, its Sub-processors, or its personnel. A Security Incident shall also include any breach of the physical or technical security measures implemented by the Provider as set forth in this Agreement.\n\n**25.2 Initial Notification.** In the event that the Provider becomes aware of a Security Incident, Provider shall notify the Customer without undue delay, and in any event no later than twenty-four (24) to forty-eight (48) hours after becoming aware of such incident. Such notification shall be delivered via [specified method, e.g., email to the Customer’s designated security contact or through the administrative portal]. Initial notification shall not be delayed due to incomplete information and shall be provided based on the information then available.\n\n**25.3 Content of Notification.** The notification provided to the Customer shall, at a minimum, include:\n*   (a) A description of the nature of the Security Incident, including, where possible, the categories and approximate number of data subjects and records concerned;\n*   (b) The date and time the incident occurred and was discovered;\n*   (c) The name and contact details of the Provider’s Data Protection Officer (DPO) or other point of contact from whom further information can be obtained;\n*   (d) A preliminary assessment of the likely consequences of the Security Incident; and\n*   (e) A description of the measures taken or proposed to be taken by the Provider to address the Security Incident and mitigate its possible adverse effects.\n\n**25.4 Ongoing Updates and Cooperation.** Following the initial notification, the Provider shall provide the Customer with regular (at least daily, unless otherwise agreed) status updates regarding the progress of its investigation and remediation efforts. Provider shall cooperate fully with the Customer, and at the Customer’s request, with law enforcement and relevant regulatory authorities, to facilitate the Customer’s compliance with its own notification obligations under Applicable Law (e.g., GDPR, CCPA/CPRA, HIPAA).\n\n**25.5 Remediation and Mitigation.** Upon discovery of a Security Incident, the Provider shall immediately, at its own expense:\n*   (a) Take all necessary steps to contain, stop, and mitigate the effects of the Security Incident;\n*   (b) Conduct a comprehensive root-cause analysis and forensic investigation into the incident;\n*   (c) Implement all necessary remedial measures to prevent a recurrence of the incident; and\n*   (d) Preserve all relevant evidence, including logs, traffic data, and system images, for a period of no less than one (1) year or as required by law.\n\n**25.6 Regulatory and Public Communication.** The Provider shall not make any public statements or notify any third parties (excepting law enforcement and professional advisors under a duty of confidentiality) regarding a Security Incident that identifies or involves the Customer’s Data without the Customer’s prior written consent, unless such notification is expressly required by Applicable Law. In the event the Provider is legally compelled to make a disclosure, it shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide the Customer with prior notice and an opportunity to review and comment on the content of the disclosure.\n\n**25.7 Costs and Expenses.** If a Security Incident is caused by the Provider’s failure to maintain the security standards mandated by this Agreement or through the negligence or willful misconduct of the Provider or its Sub-processors, the Provider shall be responsible for all reasonable costs incurred by the Customer in connection with the incident. Such costs include, but are not limited to:\n*   (a) Forensic investigation and audit costs;\n*   (b) Costs of providing legally required notifications to affected data subjects, regulators, and third parties;\n*   (c) Costs of establishing a toll-free call center for affected individuals;\n*   (d) Credit monitoring and identity theft restoration services for affected individuals for a period of at least twelve (12) months; and\n*   (e) Reasonable attorneys\' fees and litigation costs.\n\n**25.8 Post-Incident Report.** Within thirty (30) days of the resolution of a Security Incident, the Provider shall provide the Customer with a detailed written report (a “Post-Mortem”) outlining the final findings of the investigation, the corrective actions taken, and the improved security protocols implemented to prevent future occurrences.\n\n**25.9 No Admission of Fault.** Notification of a Security Incident by the Provider shall not be construed as an acknowledgment or admission by the Provider of any fault, liability, or negligence with respect to the incident, unless such fault is established through the investigation.\n\n***\n\n### Key Legal Considerations for this Text:\n1.  **Strict Timelines:** The 24-48 hour window is standard for high-security environments but can be negotiated based on "discovery" vs. "suspicion."\n2.  **Notification Burden:** This draft places the burden of notification costs on the Provider if they are at fault, which is a common point of contention during negotiations.\n3.  **Preservation of Evidence:** Essential for insurance claims and potential litigation.\n4.  **Public Relations Control:** Section 25.6 ensures the Customer controls the narrative regarding their own data, preventing the Provider from "pre-empting" the news.', 'extras': {'signature': 'EtAPCs0PAb4+9vutRhd1sJm49+xzPg1UILZW9f1yUu8/pFT3JvhhjuWZcwi3Y5yWraouZ9+W1qpHgGi6hv6LSGL6FOdrg/NeJe2nikx0TQ/4uNlvPHMZNvlpVW2jwgnvVtQvHK7bbxx8v6WndVCRYqlerEzMsYqX8jlX0xda30Hwa38PqLbh8aHobleu4yTKQKEfQr1QUsOwCjzPfN7qCdD+70TDoBggAG2pX9ksKnhps68qui0rWeMa25NLeCOQYv4dJFWEfQX4zf2pAdx7HJoc4CGy8pjTbZNXnqqO0py/dyBCbBe5eTA4ii3CtJH4yPwAYPiEzr2k+J6+mSeF/y0jQee0+rCzgAIkIKURT8sOYLzoGKVfdX30HhFhq/8YUIHVGx2fQZIzr7wO3zezK6MiOFW+JRoA72g8iETv7YBs/BH/EU6Qk31ucsafcEqZkhEq9TMwgpbmYAd5Q4Hnd9l5y/Er9/56rL4frtII95V5LkX8uH7YKvbLDcDfcN54bIlGwvPLiL7v07DKWN9sVt4k8fce75UAavKxdLoN4TrtsQZtgtSTDKs4oqd0apxIv9CG1MTJsFCn0+tNI6SUJl6eICEocKaaYIqPGFi6NAMm0w4hoU0xMO0EBpAwF/0QaAhLBJfrfrie4INXgJWZ9uD+bp3u26wenKCJtog/BRIRteS1zJ9RKgQyXB8NL4v7xWpQeBUtl+wD6n4k0EDArWPV2HFh1IHYK2zeX2UyQQKIlmqGnbakCakTcnS2jvSovXoHzlc1hWu8KXlITa0PVYpcLUupJbaTZ4SIK1gItxnC/SxmTJaEsISZZL7jvSw00+qKcc53mJSRoeqqD7Hz0ElD8S9Ap3DQ4lKy9cjqygOxJsS+ATP6sqb8uVmrN3gQm7Y7iv5JiK42oB/V8KNi05ZIIi2Llx9/hJBd2US7CG6y8kGbhL7ASxhhmzpsJRb7PYHsXcumBMo5zOsrtYPhIFIemmYlF//V3guLuPu+dscduhLvKUfD1dAh4uB1Zr6JTVEVBkqaj/TEO00gx6Rp//GrNh+ydIv2tieSa0G94dLznwTyJ0zDV8z761Uty530AWEwmZybgJFFPhtTxZt4H55TNvtCClgABtNHgQ9XEY4EO90CuCLp8Gn6qEpB4ELdARaDxstGrSB1QX8AV3VvpBJf7l2/HfXvg63+303ro+bGzeggoHyzCiGf1iE46rv67sGI21YapWMisnINoIq5/4VG67swvllt0zn+xtOjVKnOb3MK/DDPW1+3RUvUaM0baRwmS8D3nyJ8XPbR95+EJpgS9CxSyxPRT4XKxbRml8ngzV1BS6fE98nI+6Jzidjm94/apaX3fJQwUNS5Qv/dbMrnDXP1pyIaXLFielh2ZOqb79KmMdHrJ44wqPGtj4mWEH3tOEE5SVAOE9HA2bqZPA6vC2ROiMP/ePaYJXRZNp9q82OLJR604fuOOLMwjtng+n431oF8AQvkF8Bd16mmAYviq17RVwbjvS0GDslkBgIek08fxBGziGUTyDoNg8xBmnl/710BeIFQFDxAuSKgsVbXa/lJi8TlJueYks52Z4vWsQW8sOe5rX80MEpkR3Rq312/yvI1ZzvXqdKCOMUnMJF6dSKheMI1mOZbirASIS1giJ1f80KegoJBpkh6KKLLM4yfbSXnrF6YmB56r/jl9+9a37Kl2UZjhuT6O7S36nsCYO4oGOPqDVw8NDGlp68siaKcZpcFsN3CVQ4gLhyS8R+eqZvRdvvC4ubK08fu0PzDdgZLhqZeoxFSlj4ZtQeHXnLNeUK3tlbAzjwzH1iftVy+vgKYYMmKrvQYSqIZ/DlGlMi0sPiwck43o75HTYAijC+eebkMCttYJOoSYf+TEWu5KaZTnLS3fkoiH9jhTGsDFPa1tfZyXA+30ZAdsvle2E7xNDu2P5MvdreUlHVfhRRX9df9rm22pgNdwFmVq7h3nciU6DipjBWihnqSD5zHwWk1d6pQOQKBnNS3sM1ChyCeRMeRJt9tSqoC/pkigaiYbEUpxlEG5L9kBF1kBDPNNoF3pqDrZm4RO7dYz4qQdQJ0uJoacysxmPDcT0eKj86AAnGle0Optysuuctx0BfZqU3zngGinneD/VKVPeMiW9PZY1ByPvw8YUPLdIuYXjLsm67T9CbU7f3AHTHQVBV+IfaxsPQv2DWU2tlVKIKb6jZOvY8uSeZbQAarN3tZ2eQ6uvNAUvjFVO2ZlDXildAFJQlQ3WdK9kBf2/ZwaY0P7uynSRbZvWSfBiw/+wDZQDZmuUwoAsWghMYy7bPe2CM+Jo3mZk0NOFUG1hiP2pt2ny5TDes3TSO6ggeLeEHTLc0smskPHi7V1J1vaw0tHaoz4pSQ3zfNH6ujRarD+81EdWPdUsrsUfSdyIOrd3biOmiZHmbjqz7T9K8YcZHvdvcE4uQ7pwXtE2a/pcvKciLMqwE55TocFmV+Aa4k405Rmj44mfBaXC5JlKC22NgM6f45mgoG+RSz4fA52WZ6umZmJs8tvIaYfrjuLnHE6M0qHNOZFQZi0oBWybqd+OqiKUIAxiyh2Dv36PMFwImAZziqtBcRmspxmDCdofr3UaD5mlLf8I4qER3LMhsu5mmG1th5KCu89YkzSmalwWD9/UO7h7z6ahrGrJe3On1QfoGrLScw+Kc='}}]

[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'This is a comprehensive and professionally drafted legal section regarding **Provider Performance Warranties**. It is designed for use in high-stakes commercial contracts, such as Master Service Agreements (MSAs), SaaS Agreements, or Professional Services Contracts.\n\n***\n\n### 29.

Provider further warrants that the Services shall be compatible with the operating systems, hardware, and software environments expressly identified as compatible in the Documentation.\n\n**29.3 Personnel and Resources.** Provider represents and warrants that it has and shall maintain sufficient resources, including qualified personnel, equipment, and technology, to perform its obligations under this Agreement. Provider warrants that all employees and subcontractors assigned to perform the Services have been subjected to comprehensive background checks and possess the necessary legal authorizations to perform such work. Provider shall be solely responsible for the acts and omissions of its personnel and subcontractors as if they were the acts or omissions of the Provider itself.\n\n**29.4 Non-Infringement and Authority.** Provider represents and warrants that: (a) it has the full right, power, and authority to enter into this Agreement and to grant the licenses and rights granted herein; (b) the Services and Deliverables, and Client’s use thereof, do not and will not infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate any intellectual property rights (including patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets) or other proprietary rights of any third party; and (c) there are no pending or, to Provider’s knowledge, threatened claims, litigation, or proceedings that would inhibit Provider’s ability to perform its obligations hereunder.\n\n**29.5 Malicious Code and Security.** Provider warrants that it shall use industry-standard tools and rigorous technological safeguards to ensure that the Services, including any software or data transmitted to Client, shall be free of any "Malicious Code," defined as viruses, worms, Trojan horses, time bombs, back doors, trap doors, or other harmful or malicious code, files, scripts, agents, or programs intended to or having the effect of damaging, detrimentally interfering with, surreptitiously intercepting, or expropriating any system, data, or personal information.\n\n**29.6 Legal and Regulatory Compliance.** Provider represents and warrants that its performance of the Services and its business operations are, and shall remain, in material compliance with all applicable federal, state, local, and international laws, statutes, ordinances, and regulations, including but not limited to data privacy and protection laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), labor laws, and anti-corruption statutes (e.g., FCPA).\n\n**29.7 Remedies for Breach of Warranty.** In the event of a breach of any warranty set forth in this Section 29, Client shall notify Provider in writing describing the deficiency.

## 30. Customer Representations and Warranties

[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'This is a comprehensive and detailed legal provision for a **Customer Representations and Warranties** section. It is designed for use in high-stakes commercial contracts, such as SaaS agreements, Master Service Agreements (MSAs), or complex Professional Services Agreements.\n\n***\n\n### 30. Customer Representations and Warranties\n\n**30.1. Power and Authority.** The Customer represents and warrants that: (i) it is a corporation or legal entity duly organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or formation; (ii) it has the full corporate or institutional power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder; (iii) the execution, delivery, and performance of this Agreement has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate or institutional action; and (iv) this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid, and binding obligation of the Customer, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, or similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally.\n\n**30.2. No Conflict.** The Customer represents and warrants that the execution, delivery, and performance of this Agreement do not and will not: (i) violate the Customer’s certificate of incorporation, bylaws, or other organizational documents; (ii) violate any applicable local, state, federal, or international law, statute, rule, or regulation; or (iii) require any consent, approval, or authorization from, or notice to, any third party or governmental authority that has not already been obtained, except where the failure to obtain such consent would not have a material adverse effect on the Customer’s ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement.\n\n**30.3. Customer Content and Intellectual Property.** The Customer represents, warrants, and covenants that: (i) it is the sole and exclusive owner of, or possesses all necessary and sufficient rights, licenses, consents, and permissions to provide, the Customer Content (including all data, metadata, text, images, and other materials uploaded to the Provider’s platform); (ii) the use, reproduction, distribution, and transmission of the Customer Content by the Provider in connection with the Services does not and will not infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate any intellectual property rights, proprietary rights, or privacy rights of any third party; and (iii) the Customer Content does not contain any libelous, defamatory, or unlawful material.\n\n**30.4. Compliance with Laws and Export Controls.** The Customer represents and warrants that it is, and shall remain for the duration of the Term, in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, including but not limited to: (i) all applicable data protection and privacy laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA/CPRA, etc.); (ii) all anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and the UK Bribery Act; and (iii) all export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations maintained by the United States (e.g., OFAC) and any other relevant jurisdiction. The Customer further warrants that it is not located in a country subject to a U.S. Government embargo and is not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.\n\n**30.5. Information Accuracy.** The Customer represents and warrants that all information provided to the Provider for the purposes of account creation, billing, and identity verification is true, accurate, and complete in all material respects. The Customer covenants to promptly notify the Provider of any material change in such information during the Term.\n\n**30.6. No Malicious Code.** The Customer represents and warrants that it shall not, and shall not permit any Authorized User to, upload to the Services or Provider’s systems any "Malicious Code," defined as viruses, worms, time bombs, Trojan horses, and other harmful or malicious code, files, scripts, agents, or programs intended to destroy, disrupt, or impede the operation of the Services or gain unauthorized access to the Provider’s underlying infrastructure.\n\n**30.7. Professional/Business Purpose.** The Customer represents and warrants that it is entering into this Agreement solely for professional, business, or commercial purposes, and not as a consumer for personal, family, or household purposes.\n\n**30.8. No Pending Litigation.** The Customer represents and warrants that there is no claim, action, suit, investigation, or proceeding pending or, to the Customer’s knowledge, threatened against the Customer or its properties that would materially and adversely affect the Customer’s ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or the validity or enforceability of this Agreement.\n\n**30.9. Reliance.** The Customer acknowledges that the Provider has entered into this Agreement in reliance upon the representations and warranties set forth in this Section 30. Each representation and warranty shall be deemed to be material and shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement. Any breach of this Section 30 shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement, entitling the Provider to exercise all available legal and equitable remedies, including immediate termination for cause.\n\n***\n\n### Key Features of this Text:\n*   **Mutuality and Authority:** Establishes that the customer is a "real" entity with the legal right to sign.\n*   **IP Protection:** Shifts the burden of "copyright/data ownership" entirely to the customer, protecting the provider from infringement suits.\n*   **Regulatory Compliance:** Explicitly mentions FCPA, OFAC, and Data Privacy (GDPR/CCPA), which are critical for international business.\n*   **Anti-Virus/Malware:** Includes a warranty against "Malicious Code" to protect the provider\'s technical environment.\n*   **Enforcement:** Section 30.9 (Reliance) makes it clear that if any of these are false, it is a material breach, allowing for immediate termination.\n\n***Disclaimer: This text is provided for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice. You should consult with qualified legal counsel to ensure this language is appropriate for your specific jurisdiction and business model.***', 'extras': {'signature': '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'}}]

[{'type': 'text', 'text': '**32. INDEMNIFICATION BY PROVIDER (IP INFRINGEMENT)**\n\n**32.1 Obligation to Indemnify and Defend.** Provider shall, at its sole cost and expense, defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Customer, its corporate affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, successors, and permitted assigns (collectively, the "Customer Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\' fees, expert witness fees, court costs, and disbursements) arising out of or resulting from any third-party claim, suit, action, or proceeding (each, a "Claim") alleging that the Services, Deliverables, Software, Documentation, or any other materials provided by Provider under this Agreement (collectively, the "Provider IP"), or the Customer’s use thereof in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate any third party’s intellectual property rights, including but not limited to any patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, or other proprietary right worldwide.\n\n**32.2 Indemnification Procedures.** Provider’s obligations under Section 32.1 are contingent upon the following: (a) Customer providing Provider with prompt written notice of any Claim for which it seeks indemnification, provided that any delay in providing such notice shall not relieve Provider of its obligations except to the extent that Provider is materially prejudiced by such delay; (b) Customer granting Provider sole control over the defense and settlement of the Claim, provided that Provider shall not enter into any settlement that admits liability on the part of Customer or imposes any financial or restrictive obligation upon Customer without Customer’s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed; and (c) Customer providing reasonable cooperation and assistance to Provider, at Provider’s expense, in the defense of such Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer shall have the right to participate in the defense of any Claim with counsel of its own choosing at its own expense.\n\n**32.3 Remedial Alternatives.** If any Provider IP becomes, or in Provider’s reasonable opinion is likely to become, the subject of an infringement Claim, or if the use thereof is enjoined, Provider shall, at its own expense and at its option: (a) procure for Customer the right to continue using the affected Provider IP; (b) replace or modify the affected Provider IP so that it becomes non-infringing and remains functionally equivalent in all material respects; or (c) if neither (a) nor (b) is commercially practicable despite Provider’s best efforts, terminate this Agreement (or the applicable SOW) with respect to the infringing portion and refund to Customer any prepaid but unearned fees for the infringing material on a pro-rata basis, together with any unamortized capital costs incurred by Customer directly related to the implementation of the infringing material.\n\n**32.4 Exceptions.** Provider shall have no obligation or liability under this Section 32 to the extent that a Claim is based upon: (a) use of the Provider IP in a manner not authorized by this Agreement or the Documentation; (b) modification of the Provider IP by any party other than Provider or its authorized subcontractors, if the infringement would not have occurred but for such modification; (c) the combination, operation, or use of the Provider IP with hardware, software, or data not provided or approved by Provider, if the infringement would not have occurred but for such combination; or (d) Provider’s compliance with specific technical designs or written specifications provided by Customer, where such design or specification is the direct cause of the infringement and could not have been implemented in a non-infringing manner.\n\n**32.5 Sole Remedy.** SUBJECT TO THE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH IN SECTION [Insert Limitation of Liability Section Number], AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION IN THIS AGREEMENT, THIS SECTION 32 STATES PROVIDER’S ENTIRE LIABILITY AND CUSTOMER’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY INFRINGEMENT, MISAPPROPRIATION, OR VIOLATION OF THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.\n\n**32.6 Survival.** The obligations set forth in this Section 32 shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement for a period of [e.g., five (5)] years, or for the duration of the applicable statute of limitations, whichever is longer.', 'extras': {'signature': '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'}}]

For the avoidance of doubt, the indemnification obligations set forth in this Section 33 are independent of, and shall not be capped by, any general limitation of liability set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, unless such limitation of liability expressly refers to this Section 33.\n\n**33.5 Exclusive Remedy.** While this Section 33 sets forth the Customer\'s financial responsibility for third-party claims, it does not preclude the Company from seeking any other cumulative remedies available at law or in equity for direct damages arising from Customer’s breach of this Agreement.\n\n**33.6 Survival.** The provisions of this Section 33 shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement for any reason and shall remain in full force and effect until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations for any Claim subject to indemnification hereunder.', 'extras': {'signature': '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'}}]

## 34. Indemnification Procedures and Conduct of Claims

[{'type': 'text', 'text': '**34. INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURES AND CONDUCT OF CLAIMS**\n\n**34.1 Notice of Claim.** If any party entitled to indemnification under this Agreement (the "Indemnified Party") receives notice of the assertion or commencement of any claim, demand, action, suit, proceeding, or investigation (each, a "Claim") by a third party for which the other party (the "Indemnifying Party") is obligated to provide indemnification, the Indemnified Party shall provide the Indemnifying Party with reasonably prompt written notice thereof (a "Claim Notice"). Such Claim Notice shall, to the extent then known: (a) describe the Claim in reasonable detail; (b) include copies of all material notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party; and (c) state the estimated amount of the Losses (to the extent quantifiable) and the specific basis for the Indemnified Party’s entitlement to indemnification. The failure to provide a Claim Notice in a timely manner shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that the defense of such Claim has been materially and irremediably prejudiced by the Indemnified Party\'s failure or delay in providing such notice.\n\n**34.2 Assumption of Defense.** The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, exercisable by written notice to the Indemnified Party within fifteen (15) business days of receipt of the Claim Notice, to assume the sole control of the defense, negotiation, and settlement of such Claim at the Indemnifying Party’s sole cost and expense, utilizing legal counsel of its selection, provided such counsel is reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume or maintain control of the defense of any Claim if: (i) the Claim seeks an injunction, specific performance, or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party; (ii) the Indemnified Party has been advised by legal counsel that a conflict of interest exists between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party that would make separate representation necessary under applicable professional standards; (iii) the Claim involves criminal allegations; or (iv) the Indemnifying Party fails to diligently prosecute the defense of the Claim.\n\n**34.3 Participation and Separate Counsel.** If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of a Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its own expense, to participate in the defense and to employ separate counsel to monitor the proceedings. However, if the Indemnifying Party is prohibited from assuming the defense pursuant to Section 34.2, or if the Indemnifying Party fails to timely assume the defense, the Indemnified Party may defend the Claim in any manner it deems appropriate at the Indemnifying Party’s sole cost and expense. In such event, the Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for its reasonable legal fees and costs on a monthly basis.\n\n**34.4 Settlement of Claims.**\n(a) *By the Indemnifying Party:* The Indemnifying Party shall not enter into any settlement, compromise, or consent to the entry of any judgment regarding a Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed), unless the settlement: (i) involves only the payment of monetary damages for which the Indemnifying Party is fully liable; (ii) includes an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all liability in respect of the Claim; and (iii) does not include any admission of wrongdoing, culpability, or a failure to act by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party, nor imposes any ongoing obligation or restrictive covenant upon the Indemnified Party.\n(b) *By the Indemnified Party:* If the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense, the Indemnified Party shall not settle or compromise any Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party has failed or refused to assume the defense, the Indemnified Party may settle the Claim on such terms as it deems fit, and the Indemnifying Party shall remain liable for the resulting Losses, provided the settlement is commercially reasonable.\n\n**34.5 Cooperation.** The parties shall cooperate in good faith in the defense or prosecution of any third-party Claim. Such cooperation shall include, without limitation: (a) the retention and (upon the other party\'s request) the provision of records and information reasonably relevant to the Claim; (b) making employees and agents available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder or to serve as witnesses; and (c) providing access to properties and facilities. The Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Losses for which it seeks indemnification, provided that all costs of mitigation shall themselves constitute Indemnified Losses.\n\n**34.6 Direct Claims.** In the event an Indemnified Party has a claim against the Indemnifying Party that does not involve a third-party Claim (a "Direct Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall deliver a written notice to the Indemnifying Party describing the Direct Claim in reasonable detail, the amount of the estimated Losses, and the basis for the claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days that it disputes the Direct Claim, the amount of such Losses shall be deemed conclusively established and the Indemnifying Party shall pay such amount on demand. If the Indemnifying Party disputes the Direct Claim within such thirty-day period, the parties shall attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute for a period of thirty (30) days prior to initiating any formal legal proceedings.\n\n**34.7 Subrogation.** Upon the payment in full of any indemnification amount for a third-party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to every right of recovery the Indemnified Party may have against third parties with respect to the matters to which such payment relates. The Indemnified Party shall execute and deliver all instruments and papers required and do whatever else is necessary to secure such rights and shall provide reasonable assistance (at the Indemnifying Party’s expense) to enable the Indemnifying Party to exercise such rights.', 'extras': {'signature': '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'}}]

## 35. Limitation of Liability: Direct Damages Cap

[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'This is a dense, legally robust draft of a **Direct Damages Cap** section, suitable for high-stakes commercial contracts (such as SaaS agreements, Master Service Agreements, or complex licensing deals).\n\n***\n\n### 35. Limitation of Liability: Direct Damages Cap\n\n**35.1. Aggregate Financial Limitation.** Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the total, cumulative, and aggregate liability of either Party (including their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, and subcontractors) arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, the performance or contemplated performance of the Services, or any Order Form issued hereunder—whether such liability arises from any claim based upon contract, warranty, tort (including negligence, whether active, passive, or imputed), strict liability, product liability, professional errors or omissions, contribution, or any other legal or equitable theory—shall not exceed, in the aggregate, the total amounts actually paid by Customer to Provider under the specific Order Form giving rise to the claim during the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the date on which the event first giving rise to the liability occurred (the “Direct Damages Cap”).\n\n**35.2. Multiplicity of Claims.** The existence of one or more claims shall not enlarge or extend the Direct Damages Cap. Customer acknowledges and agrees that the Direct Damages Cap shall apply regardless of whether any remedy set forth herein fails of its essential purpose. In no event shall the Provider’s total liability for all claims arising under this Agreement in its entirety exceed the total fees paid by Customer to Provider during the term of this Agreement.\n\n**35.3. Exclusions from the Cap.** The limitations of liability set forth in Section 35.1 shall not apply to, and no cap shall be placed upon, a Party’s liability resulting from:\n*   **(a)** death or personal injury caused by a Party’s negligence;\n*   **(b)** acts of fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, or willful misconduct;\n*   **(c)** Customer’s obligation to pay undisputed fees, expenses, or taxes due under Section [X] of this Agreement;\n*   **(d)** breach of the confidentiality obligations set forth in Section [X], excluding claims related to Data Breaches (which shall be governed by the specific Super-Cap defined in Section 35.4, if applicable); or\n*   **(e)** a Party’s express indemnification obligations under Section [X] (Intellectual Property Indemnity).\n\n**35.4. Specific Super-Cap for Data Privacy.** [Optional/Negotiated Clause] Notwithstanding Section 35.1, but subject to the exclusions in Section 35.3, any liability arising from a Party’s breach of its obligations under Section [X] (Data Protection/Privacy) or the Data Processing Addendum (DPA) shall be subject to a separate aggregate limit equal to two times (2x) the Direct Damages Cap (the “Data Privacy Super-Cap”). For the avoidance of doubt, the Data Privacy Super-Cap shall be the maximum total liability for such breaches and shall not be in addition to the Direct Damages Cap, but shall encompass it.\n\n**35.5. Allocation of Risk.** The Parties acknowledge and agree that the pricing for the Services provided under this Agreement has been set in express reliance upon the limitations of liability and the allocation of risk set forth in this Section 35. The Parties further agree that these limitations are reasonable and constitute an essential basis of the bargain between the Parties, and that the Services would not have been provided in the absence of such limitations.\n\n**35.6. Statute of Limitations.** To the extent permitted by law, no action, regardless of form, arising out of or relating to this Agreement may be brought by either Party more than two (2) years after the cause of action has accrued, or more than two (2) years after the Party asserting the claim should have reasonably discovered the facts giving rise to the claim, whichever is earlier.\n\n**35.7. Exclusive Remedies.** The remedies expressly provided in this Agreement are the sole and exclusive remedies available to the Parties. Each Party waives any right to seek damages or other remedies that are inconsistent with the limitations set forth in this Section 35.\n\n***\n\n### Key Legal Components of this Text:\n1.  **The Formulaic Cap:** Uses a "rolling 12-month" look-back, which is the industry standard for protecting the vendor as the contract grows.\n2.  **Breadth of Theory:** Explicitly mentions "tort, negligence, and strict liability" to prevent the counterparty from circumventing the cap by suing outside of "contract law."\n3.  **The "Aggregate" Qualifier:** Ensures that the cap is a "bucket" for all claims, not a "per-incident" cap that could bankrupt a provider through multiple small breaches.\n4.  **Failure of Essential Purpose:** A standard "boilerplate" protection that ensures the cap remains even if the contract\'s primary remedy (like a refund or repair) doesn\'t work.\n5.  **The Super-Cap (Section 35.4):** Addresses the modern reality of GDPR/CCPA. Often, parties will agree to a higher cap for data breaches than for general performance issues.\n6.  **Economic Justification (Section 35.5):** This helps the clause survive a "unconscionability" challenge in court by stating the price was directly tied to the limitation of risk.', 'extras': {'signature': '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'}}]

This exclusion applies regardless of the form of action, whether such liability is asserted on the basis of contract, tort (including, without limitation, negligence and strict liability), breach of statutory duty, indemnity, contribution, or otherwise, even if the Party has been advised of the possibility of such damages or if such damages were reasonably foreseeable.\n\n**36.2 Specific Categories of Excluded Losses.** Without limiting the generality of Section 36.1, the Parties expressly agree that the following categories of losses are strictly excluded and shall not be recoverable under any circumstances:\n(a) **Loss of Profits and Revenue:** Any loss of actual or anticipated profits, loss of revenue, loss of business, or loss of contracts;\n(b) **Operational Losses:** Any loss of production, business interruption, loss of use, or increased cost of working;\n(c) **Data and Technology Losses:** Any loss of, damage to, or corruption of data, digital assets, or software, including the costs of data recovery or reconstruction;\n(d) **Commercial Opportunity:** Any loss of goodwill, loss of reputation, loss of opportunity, or loss of anticipated savings;\n(e) **Cost of Cover:** The cost of procurement of substitute goods, services, or technology; and\n(f) **Asset Diminution:** Any diminution in value of assets or any "multiplier" or "days-sales-outstanding" type damages.\n\n**36.3 Essential Purpose and Allocation of Risk.** The Parties acknowledge and agree that the limitations and exclusions contained in this Section 36 are a fundamental part of the basis of the bargain and reflect a negotiated allocation of risk between the Parties.

These exclusions shall apply notwithstanding the failure of the essential purpose of any limited remedy provided herein.\n\n**36.4 Jurisdictional Carve-Out.** In the event that the laws of a particular jurisdiction do not permit the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages, the liability of the Parties shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by the laws of such jurisdiction.

## 37. Insurance Coverage Requirements

[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'This is a comprehensive, dense legal provision suitable for a Master Service Agreement (MSA), Construction Contract, or Commercial Lease. It is drafted to protect the interests of the party hiring the contractor/service provider (the "Company").\n\n***\n\n### 37. INSURANCE COVERAGE REQUIREMENTS\n\n**37.1 Maintenance of Coverage.** Without limiting any of the Contractor’s obligations or liabilities under this Agreement, the Contractor shall, at its sole cost and expense, procure and maintain in full force and effect during the term of this Agreement (and for such period thereafter as may be specified herein) the insurance coverages set forth in this Section 37. Such insurance shall be placed with insurers possessing an A.M. Best’s rating of no less than A- (Excellent), Financial Size Category VII, or as otherwise reasonably acceptable to the Company.\n\n**37.2 Minimum Scope and Limits of Insurance.** Contractor shall maintain the following minimum limits of liability:\n\n*   **(a) Commercial General Liability (CGL):** Insurance written on an ISO occurrence form (CG 00 01 04 13 or its equivalent) covering liability arising from premises, operations, independent contractors, products-completed operations, personal and advertising injury, and liability assumed under an insured contract. The limits of liability shall not be less than $2,000,000 per occurrence and $4,000,000 in the general aggregate. Such policy shall not contain any exclusions relating to punitive or exemplary damages, or "cross-suits" between insureds.\n*   **(b) Business Automobile Liability:** Insurance covering any auto (including owned, hired, and non-owned autos) with a limit of liability not less than $1,000,000 combined single limit per accident for bodily injury and property damage.\n*   **(c) Workers’ Compensation and Employer’s Liability:** Workers’ Compensation insurance as required by the laws of the state(s) in which the services are to be performed, including "Other States" coverage. Employer’s Liability insurance shall be maintained with limits of not less than $1,000,000 each accident for bodily injury by accident, $1,000,000 each employee for bodily injury by disease, and $1,000,000 policy limit for bodily injury by disease.\n*   **(d) Professional Liability (Errors and Omissions):** Insurance appropriate to the Contractor’s profession, with limits not less than $3,000,000 per claim and $3,000,000 in the aggregate. If such policy is written on a "claims-made" basis, the Contractor warrants that any retroactive date under the policy shall precede the effective date of this Agreement and that continuous coverage will be maintained, or an extended discovery period will be exercised, for a period of three (3) years beginning from the time services under this Agreement are completed.\n*   **(e) Cyber Liability and Data Breach Insurance:** Insurance covering losses arising from a breach of data security, privacy, or unauthorized access to confidential information, including notification costs, regulatory fines, and legal defense, with limits not less than $5,000,000 per claim.\n*   **(f) Umbrella/Excess Liability:** Insurance providing excess coverage over the primary CGL, Automobile Liability, and Employer’s Liability policies, with limits of not less than $5,000,000 per occurrence and in the aggregate. The Umbrella/Excess policy shall be "follow-form" to the underlying policies and shall drop down in the event of exhaustion of underlying limits.\n\n**37.3 General Conditions and Endorsements.**\n\n*   **(a) Additional Insured Status:** The Company, its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents (collectively, the "Company Indemnitees") shall be named as Additional Insureds under the CGL, Automobile Liability, and Umbrella/Excess Liability policies. This coverage shall be provided via ISO endorsements CG 20 10 and CG 20 37 (or their equivalents) and shall apply to both "ongoing operations" and "completed operations."\n*   **(b) Primary and Non-Contributory:** All insurance policies required hereunder (excepting Workers’ Compensation and Professional Liability) shall be primary and non-contributing with any insurance or self-insurance program maintained by the Company. Any insurance maintained by the Company shall be in excess of the Contractor’s insurance and shall not contribute with it.\n*   **(c) Waiver of Subrogation:** To the fullest extent permitted by law, Contractor hereby waives all rights of subrogation against the Company Indemnitees. Contractor shall cause its insurers to waive their rights of subrogation and to provide endorsements to this effect on all policies required herein.\n*   **(d) Separation of Insureds:** All liability policies shall contain a "Separation of Insureds" or "Severability of Interests" clause, stating that the insurance applies separately to each insured against whom a claim is made or suit is brought, except with respect to the limits of the insurer’s liability.\n\n**37.4 Notice of Cancellation or Material Change.** Contractor shall provide the Company with at least thirty (30) days’ prior written notice (and ten (10) days’ notice for non-payment of premium) of any cancellation, non-renewal, or material reduction in coverage or limits of any policy required under this Section.\n\n**37.5 Evidence of Insurance.** Prior to the commencement of any work or services, and upon each policy renewal or replacement thereafter, Contractor shall furnish the Company with Certificates of Insurance (COI) and copies of the required Additional Insured and Waiver of Subrogation endorsements. The receipt or review of any COI by the Company shall not be deemed a waiver of Contractor’s obligation to provide the insurance required by this Agreement, nor shall it be deemed a representation that the insurance provided by Contractor complies with these requirements.\n\n**37.6 Deductibles and Self-Insured Retentions (SIR).** Any deductibles or self-insured retentions must be declared to and approved by the Company. Contractor shall be solely responsible for the payment of all deductibles and SIRs. No deductible or SIR shall diminish the protection afforded to the Company Indemnitees under this Section.\n\n**37.7 Failure to Maintain Insurance.** The failure of Contractor to maintain the insurance required herein shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement. In the event of such breach, the Company may, at its sole discretion: (i) immediately terminate this Agreement for cause; (ii) withhold payments otherwise due to Contractor until evidence of compliance is provided; or (iii) procure the required insurance on behalf of Contractor and offset the cost of premiums against any sums due to Contractor.\n\n**37.8 No Limitation of Liability.** The insolvency, bankruptcy, or failure of any insurance company to pay a claim shall not relieve Contractor of its obligations. The minimum insurance limits required in this Section 37 shall not be construed to limit the Contractor’s liability or indemnification obligations under this Agreement.', 'extras': {'signature': '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'}}]

## 38. Term of Agreement and Renewal Mechanisms

[{'type': 'text', 'text': '**38. TERM OF AGREEMENT AND RENEWAL MECHANISMS**\n\n**38.1 Initial Term.** \nThis Agreement shall commence on the date of the final signature hereto (the "Effective Date") and shall remain in full force and effect for an initial period of [Number] ([#]) years (the "Initial Term"), unless terminated earlier in accordance with the express revocation or termination provisions set forth in Section [X] of this Agreement. The Initial Term represents a firm commitment by both Parties to the performance of their respective obligations hereunder, subject to any conditions precedent specifically enumerated in the Scope of Work or Appendices attached hereto.\n\n**38.2 Automatic Renewal (Evergreen Provision).** \nUpon the expiration of the Initial Term, this Agreement shall automatically renew for successive, consecutive periods of [Number] ([#]) months/years each (each, a "Renewal Term" and, collectively with the Initial Term, the "Term"), unless either Party provides the other Party with a formal written notice of non-renewal (a "Notice of Non-Renewal") at least [Number] ([#]) days prior to the expiration of the then-current Term. In the event a Notice of Non-Renewal is timely delivered, the Agreement shall terminate at the conclusion of the then-current Term, and the Parties shall commence the wind-down and transition procedures as stipulated in Section [Y].\n\n**38.3 Optional Renewal by Affirmative Notice.** \nIn the event that the Parties have expressly opted out of the automatic renewal mechanism in the Special Conditions, this Agreement may be extended only by the mutual written agreement of the Parties. The party seeking to extend (the "Requesting Party") must submit a written request for extension to the other party (the "Receiving Party") no later than [Number] ([#]) days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or the then-current Renewal Term. The Receiving Party shall have [Number] ([#]) business days to accept or decline such extension in writing. Failure to respond within the stipulated timeframe shall be deemed a rejection of the renewal request, and the Agreement shall expire by its own terms.\n\n**38.4 Conditions Precedent to Renewal.** \nThe right of renewal—whether automatic or optional—is strictly contingent upon the following conditions being met at the time of renewal: (a) the Party seeking renewal (or benefiting from automatic renewal) must not be in material breach of any covenant, representation, or warranty contained herein; (b) all undisputed payments, fees, and disbursements due and owing under this Agreement must be paid in full; and (c) there must be no Change in Law or regulatory environment that renders the continued performance of the Agreement\'s subject matter illegal, commercially impracticable, or subject to prohibitive tax implications.\n\n**38.5 Adjustments to Consideration upon Renewal.** \nDuring each Renewal Term, the financial considerations, service fees, or unit prices set forth in Exhibit [A] (the "Pricing Schedule") shall be subject to an automatic upward adjustment. Such adjustment shall be calculated based on the greater of: (i) a fixed percentage increase of [Percentage]% over the rates applicable in the immediately preceding Term; or (ii) the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the [Region/Category] for the twelve-month period immediately preceding the renewal date. Any such adjustment shall be memorialized in a written "Renewal Price Notice" delivered by [Provider Party] to [Client Party] not less than [Number] days prior to the commencement of the Renewal Term.\n\n**38.6 Holdover Period.** \nIn the event that [Client/Licensee] continues to utilize the Services or retain possession of the Deliverables following the expiration of the Term without a formal renewal or extension in place, such continued use shall be deemed a "Holdover Period." During any Holdover Period, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall continue to apply on a month-to-month basis, terminable by either party upon [Number] days’ notice, provided that the fees payable during such Holdover Period shall be equal to [150]% of the fees in effect during the final month of the preceding Term. The existence of a Holdover Period shall not be construed as a waiver of any rights or remedies available to the [Provider/Licensor] regarding the expiration of the Agreement.\n\n**38.7 Survival of Provisions.** \nThe expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any provisions which, by their nature, are intended to survive such expiration or termination. These include, but are not limited to, provisions regarding Confidentiality (Section [Z]), Indemnification (Section [AA]), Limitation of Liability (Section [BB]), Governing Law (Section [CC]), and any payment obligations accrued prior to the date of termination.\n\n**38.8 Effect of Termination on Renewals.** \nAny notice of termination for cause, as defined in Section [X], served during any Term shall immediately supersede and nullify any previously delivered Notice of Non-Renewal or pending Renewal Term. Upon termination, all rights granted to [Client/Licensee] to renew the Agreement shall be extinguished.', 'extras': {'signature': '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'}}]

## 39. Suspension of Services

[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'This is a comprehensive, "pro-provider" legal clause for a **Section 39. Suspension of Services**. It is designed for high-stakes commercial agreements (such as SaaS, Enterprise Software, or Managed Professional Services) where the provider needs maximum leverage to ensure payment and system security.\n\n***\n\n### 39. SUSPENSION OF SERVICES\n\n**39.1. Right to Suspend.** Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to immediately suspend the Client’s access to, or use of, the Services (or any portion thereof), including but not limited to any associated software, APIs, support, or deliverables, without liability to the Client or any third party, upon the occurrence of any of the following events (each a "Suspension Event"):\n\n**(a) Delinquency in Payment.** The Client fails to pay any undisputed fees, invoices, or other charges when due, and such failure continues for a period of [five (5)] business days following the provision of written notice of such delinquency.\n\n**(b) Breach of Material Obligations.** The Company determines, in its reasonable judgment, that the Client (or its authorized users) has breached any material term of this Agreement, including but not limited to the Acceptable Use Policy, confidentiality obligations, or intellectual property restrictions.\n\n**(c) Security and Integrity Threats.** The Company determines that the Client’s use of the Services: (i) poses a security risk to the Company’s infrastructure, the Services, or any third party; (ii) may subject the Company or its affiliates to liability; (iii) is fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful; or (iv) interferes with the performance or integrity of the Services for other customers.\n\n**(d) Regulatory or Legal Requirement.** The Company is required to suspend Services to comply with any applicable law, regulation, court order, or request from a governmental or regulatory authority.\n\n**39.2. Scope and Notice.** Suspension under this Section 39 may be applied to the Client’s entire account or to specific sub-accounts, users, or Service components. The Company shall provide the Client with notice of the suspension as soon as is commercially practicable under the circumstances; provided, however, that the Company reserves the right to suspend Services without prior notice in the event of an Emergency Security Issue (defined as any situation where failure to suspend would result in immediate harm, data breach, or system instability).\n\n**39.3. Effect of Suspension.** During any period of suspension:\n(i) The Client’s right to access and use the Services shall cease immediately;\n(ii) All payment obligations of the Client under this Agreement shall continue to accrue and remain payable, including any recurring fees or minimum commitments;\n(iii) The Client shall not be entitled to any service level credits, refunds, or set-offs otherwise available under any Service Level Agreement (SLA); and\n(iv) The Company may, at its option, restrict access to any data or content stored within the Services, provided that the Company shall not be obligated to delete such data during the suspension period unless the Agreement is subsequently terminated.\n\n**39.4. Reinstatement of Services.** The Company shall reinstate the Services only after the Client has: (a) cured the breach or condition that gave rise to the suspension to the Company’s reasonable satisfaction; (b) paid all outstanding arrears, including any late payment interest and reasonable administrative costs incurred by the Company in connection with the suspension; and (c) provided adequate assurances, if requested by the Company, of future compliance with the terms of this Agreement. A reinstatement fee of $[Amount] may be assessed at the Company’s discretion as a condition of restoring access.\n\n**39.5. Limitation of Liability and Indemnification.** The Company shall not be liable for any damages, losses, expenses, or costs (including, without limitation, loss of profits, loss of data, or business interruption) that the Client or any third party may incur as a result of a suspension carried out in accordance with this Section 39. The Client agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Company from and against any claims arising out of or related to a suspension necessitated by the Client’s breach or conduct.\n\n**39.6. Relationship to Termination.** The Company’s right to suspend Services is in addition to, and not in lieu of, its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section [X] (Termination for Cause). A suspension of Services shall not be construed as a waiver of the Company’s right to terminate this Agreement for the same or subsequent events, nor shall it extend any cure periods provided elsewhere in this Agreement.\n\n***\n\n### Drafting Notes for the User:\n*   **Bracketed Items:** Note the `[five (5)]` days and `$[Amount]`—these are variables you should adjust based on your specific business requirements.\n*   **Pro-Client Mitigation:** If you are representing the Client, you would want to negotiate for "prior written notice" in all circumstances, a cap on reinstatement fees, and a requirement that the Company must "minimize the scope" of the suspension to only the affected users rather than the whole company.\n*   **Interplay with SLA:** This clause explicitly denies SLA credits during suspension, which is vital for preventing a client from claiming "downtime" credits when they were shut off for non-payment.', 'extras': {'signature': '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'}}]

## 40. Termination for Cause

[{'type': 'text', 'text': '**40. TERMINATION FOR CAUSE**\n\n**40.1. Events of Default.** Either Party (the “Non-Breaching Party”) may, without prejudice to any other rights or remedies available to it at law or in equity, terminate this Agreement in its entirety, or terminate any specific Statement of Work (SOW) then in effect, effective immediately upon written notice to the other Party (the “Breaching Party”), should any of the following events of default (each, an “Event of Default”) occur:\n\n(a) **Material Breach.** The Breaching Party commits a material breach of any term, condition, or obligation under this Agreement or any SOW, where such breach is incapable of cure, or, if capable of cure, remains uncured for a period of thirty (30) calendar days following the Breaching Party’s receipt of written notice specifying the nature of the breach and demanding cure;\n\n(b) **Repeated Breaches.** The Breaching Party persistently or repeatedly breaches the same or different obligations under this Agreement in such a manner as to reasonably justify the opinion that its conduct is inconsistent with it having the intention or ability to give effect to the terms of this Agreement, notwithstanding that such breaches, when taken individually, may not constitute a material breach or may have been cured;\n\n(c) **Insolvency and Bankruptcy.** To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Breaching Party: (i) becomes insolvent or admits its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due; (ii) becomes subject, voluntarily or involuntarily, to any proceeding under any domestic or foreign bankruptcy or insolvency law; (iii) makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors; or (iv) has a receiver, trustee, custodian, or similar agent appointed by order of any court of competent jurisdiction to take charge of or sell any material portion of its property or business;\n\n(d) **Criminal or Fraudulent Acts.** The Breaching Party, or any of its personnel, is found to have engaged in fraud, embezzlement, misappropriation of funds, or any other criminal act in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, or is indicted for a felony or a crime involving moral turpitude that materially impairs the Breaching Party’s ability to perform or damages the reputation of the Non-Breaching Party;\n\n(e) **Violation of Laws or Compliance.** The Breaching Party fails to comply with any applicable laws, regulations, or ordinances, including but not limited to anti-corruption laws (e.g., FCPA, UK Bribery Act), data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), or export control laws, and such failure results in a material adverse effect on the Non-Breaching Party;\n\n(f) **Unauthorized Assignment.** The Breaching Party attempts to assign, sublicense, or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement in violation of the anti-assignment provisions set forth in Section [X] herein.\n\n**40.2. Immediate Termination.** Notwithstanding the cure period set forth in Section 40.1(a), the Non-Breaching Party may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice if the breach involves a violation of the Confidentiality (Section [X]), Intellectual Property Rights (Section [X]), or Non-Solicitation (Section [X]) provisions of this Agreement, or if the Breaching Party’s conduct poses a significant threat to the security, integrity, or stability of the Non-Breaching Party’s infrastructure or data.\n\n**40.3. Effect of Termination for Cause.** Upon termination of this Agreement for cause:\n\n(a) **Cessation of Services.** The Breaching Party shall immediately cease all performance of services and the use of any systems or materials provided by the Non-Breaching Party;\n\n(b) **Payment Obligations.** If the Non-Breaching Party is the Customer, it shall pay for all Services actually and satisfactorily performed up to the effective date of termination, provided that the Customer may withhold from such payment any amounts necessary to offset damages, costs, and expenses incurred as a result of the Event of Default. If the Non-Breaching Party is the Provider, all unpaid fees for Services rendered through the date of termination shall become immediately due and payable;\n\n(c) **Return of Property.** Each Party shall, within ten (10) business days, return to the other Party or, at the other Party’s option, destroy and certify the destruction of all Confidential Information, materials, documentation, and property belonging to the other Party in its possession or control;\n\n(d) **Step-In Rights.** In the event of a termination resulting from the Provider’s default, the Customer shall have the right, but not the obligation, to assume the performance of the Services itself or engage a third party to do so. The Provider shall cooperate fully in the transition of such Services and shall be liable for any reasonable excess costs incurred by the Customer in procuring substitute services.\n\n**40.4. Remedies Cumulative.** The right of termination under this Section 40 is not an exclusive remedy. The Non-Breaching Party shall be entitled to pursue all other remedies available under this Agreement, at law, or in equity, including but not limited to seeking injunctive relief and the recovery of compensatory and consequential damages (subject to the Limitation of Liability provisions in Section [X]).\n\n**40.5. Survival.** Any provision of this Agreement which, by its nature, is intended to survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement shall survive, including but not limited to Section 40.3 (Effect of Termination), Section [X] (Confidentiality), Section [X] (Indemnification), and Section [X] (Limitation of Liability).\n\n**40.6. Waiver of Breach.** The failure of the Non-Breaching Party to exercise its right to terminate for cause upon the occurrence of an Event of Default shall not constitute a waiver of such right or a waiver of any subsequent Event of Default.', 'extras': {'signature': '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'}}]

## 41. Termination for Insolvency or Bankruptcy

[{'type': 'text', 'text': '**41. TERMINATION FOR INSOLVENCY OR BANKRUPTCY**\n\n**41.1 Right of Immediate Termination.** Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, either Party (the “Terminating Party”) may, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, terminate this Agreement in its entirety and without the requirement of a cure period, effective immediately upon delivery of written notice of termination to the other Party (the “Insolvent Party”), should the Insolvent Party be the subject of an Insolvency Event (as defined in Section 41.2).\n\n**41.2 Definition of Insolvency Event.** For the purposes of this Agreement, an “Insolvency Event” shall be deemed to occur with respect to a Party if that Party:\n(a) stops or suspends, or threatens to stop or suspend, payment of its debts as they become due, or is otherwise deemed unable to pay its debts under any applicable bankruptcy or insolvency legislation;\n(b) commences a voluntary case or other proceeding seeking liquidation, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, protection, or composition of its debts under any law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, or relief of debtors, or seeks the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian, conservator, or other similar official for itself or for any substantial part of its property;\n(c) has an involuntary case or other proceeding commenced against it seeking liquidation, reorganization, or other relief with respect to it or its debts under any bankruptcy or insolvency law, which proceeding (i) results in the entry of an order for relief or a decree of adjudication of bankruptcy or insolvency, or (ii) remains undismissed, unstayed, or unbonded for a period of sixty (60) consecutive days;\n(d) makes a general assignment, arrangement, or composition with or for the benefit of its creditors;\n(e) consents to the appointment of or taking possession by a receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, or sequestrator (or other similar official) of the Party or of any substantial part of its property;\n(f) has a resolution passed for its winding-up, official management, or liquidation (other than a voluntary solvent liquidation for the purpose of a bona fide reconstruction or amalgamation);\n(g) becomes subject to an encumbrancer taking possession of, or a receiver, manager, or administrator being appointed over, the whole or any substantial part of its undertaking, assets, or revenues; or\n(h) experiences any event in any jurisdiction that is analogous to those set forth in sub-sections (a) through (g) above.\n\n**41.3 Notice Requirements.** The Insolvent Party shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide the Terminating Party with immediate written notice of the occurrence of any Insolvency Event, or of any facts or circumstances that are reasonably likely to lead to the occurrence of an Insolvency Event. Failure to provide such notice shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement, independent of the Insolvency Event itself.\n\n**41.4 Effect of Termination.** Upon termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 41:\n(a) all rights and licenses granted to the Insolvent Party under this Agreement shall immediately cease and terminate;\n(b) the Insolvent Party shall promptly return to the Terminating Party, or at the Terminating Party’s written request, destroy, all Confidential Information, proprietary data, and any other property belonging to the Terminating Party then in the Insolvent Party’s possession or control;\n(c) the Terminating Party shall be relieved of any further performance obligations under this Agreement; and\n(d) any sums then-owing to the Terminating Party shall become immediately due and payable, notwithstanding any credit terms previously granted.\n\n**41.5 Rights in Bankruptcy (Ipso Facto Provisions).** The Parties acknowledge that this Section 41 is intended to provide the Terminating Party with the right to terminate this Agreement to the maximum extent permitted by the laws of the applicable jurisdiction. If any provision of this Section 41 is rendered unenforceable under applicable bankruptcy law (such as Section 365(e)(1) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or similar "ipso facto" stay provisions in other jurisdictions), the Parties agree that such provision shall be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law, and that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect. The Terminating Party’s right to terminate shall not be construed as an election of remedies, and the Terminating Party expressly reserves all other rights and remedies available to it at law or in equity.\n\n**41.6 Survival of Accrued Rights.** The termination of this Agreement under this Section 41 shall be without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the Terminating Party which may have accrued up to the date of termination, including but not limited to the right to claim damages in respect of any prior breach of this Agreement. All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature are intended to survive termination (including, without limitation, Indemnification, Limitation of Liability, and Confidentiality) shall survive the termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section.', 'extras': {'signature': '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'}}]

## 42. Effect of Termination and Transition Services

[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'This is a comprehensive, professionally drafted legal clause for a Master Services Agreement (MSA), Software as a Service (SaaS) agreement, or complex Outsourcing Agreement.\n\n***\n\n### 42. EFFECT OF TERMINATION AND TRANSITION SERVICES\n\n**42.1 Termination Obligations and Cessation of Rights.** Upon the effective date of expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason (the “Termination Date”):\n(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 42.2 (Transition Services), all rights, licenses, and authorizations granted by either Party to the other shall immediately terminate;\n(b) Each Party shall cease all use of the other Party’s Confidential Information and Intellectual Property;\n(c) The Service Provider shall immediately cease all performance of the Services, except as requested by the Client under the terms of a mutually agreed Transition Plan; and\n(d) Client shall pay to Service Provider all undisputed fees and expenses incurred for Services performed and deliverables accepted through the Termination Date, or as otherwise provided in the Transition Period.\n\n**42.2 Transition Services (Disengagement Assistance).** Commencing upon notice of termination or at least ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term (or any Renewal Term), and continuing for a period of up to one hundred eighty (180) days following the Termination Date (the “Transition Period”), Service Provider shall provide such “Transition Services” as are reasonably requested by Client to facilitate the orderly, non-disruptive, and seamless migration of the Services to Client or a successor third-party provider (“Successor”). \n(a) **Scope of Services:** Transition Services shall include, but are not limited to: (i) the continued performance of all or any portion of the Services; (ii) the provision of technical advice, knowledge transfer, and documentation necessary for the Successor to understand the architecture and operation of the Services; (iii) the parallel operation of systems; and (iv) the migration of Client Data in a format reasonably requested by Client.\n(b) **Transition Plan:** Within fifteen (15) days of the notice of termination, the Parties shall meet in good faith to develop a written transition plan (the “Transition Plan”) specifying the tasks, schedule, and resource requirements for the transition.\n(c) **Compensation:** Unless termination is due to Service Provider’s material breach, Transition Services shall be compensated at Service Provider’s then-current standard time-and-materials rates, or such other rates as may be agreed upon in a Statement of Work. If termination is due to Service Provider’s material breach, Transition Services shall be provided at a twenty percent (20%) discount from such rates.\n\n**42.3 Delivery of Client Data and Property.** No later than thirty (30) days after the Termination Date (or the end of the Transition Period, if applicable), Service Provider shall:\n(a) Return to Client all Client-owned hardware, equipment, and materials;\n(b) Deliver to Client a final and complete export of all Client Data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format (e.g., CSV, SQL, or JSON), at no additional cost to Client; and\n(c) Provide a written certification signed by an officer of Service Provider confirming that all Client Data, including any derivative works or backups residing on Service Provider’s systems (or systems of its subcontractors), has been permanently deleted or destroyed using industry-standard data erasure methods (e.g., NIST SP 800-88), except to the extent Service Provider is required by applicable law to retain copies for archival or regulatory purposes.\n\n**42.4 Assignment of Third-Party Licenses and Contracts.** Upon Client’s request, Service Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assign to Client or the Successor any third-party licenses, maintenance agreements, or subcontracts utilized by Service Provider specifically and exclusively for the provision of the Services to Client. Client shall be responsible for any assignment fees or transfer costs associated therewith, provided such costs are disclosed to and approved by Client in writing in advance.\n\n**42.5 Equitable Relief and Continuity of Performance.** Service Provider acknowledges that any interruption of the Services or failure to provide Transition Services may cause irreparable harm to Client’s business operations for which monetary damages alone would be inadequate. Accordingly, Service Provider agrees that it shall not withhold or "self-help" the Transition Services or Client Data in the event of a fee dispute. Service Provider’s obligation to provide Transition Services is contingent only upon Client’s payment of undisputed fees for such Transition Services as they accrue.\n\n**42.6 Survival.** The expiration or termination of this Agreement shall not affect any rights or obligations which have accrued prior to the Termination Date. Any provision of this Agreement which, by its nature, is intended to survive termination shall survive, including but not limited to: Section 12 (Confidentiality), Section 15 (Intellectual Property Ownership), Section 18 (Indemnification), Section 20 (Limitation of Liability), Section 42 (Effect of Termination and Transition Services), and Section 45 (Governing Law and Dispute Resolution).\n\n***\n\n### Key Legal Elements included:\n*   **The "Survival" Clause:** Ensures critical protections (like indemnity and confidentiality) don\'t vanish when the contract ends.\n*   **Anti-Holdout Provision:** Section 42.5 prevents the vendor from holding the client\'s data hostage during a payment dispute.\n*   **Data Portability:** Explicitly mentions machine-readable formats to avoid the vendor handing over "dead" or unusable data (like PDFs of databases).\n*   **Transition Period (Tail):** Provides a specific window (180 days) for the client to find a new vendor without a gap in service.\n*   **Clarity on Pricing:** Distinguishes between "Standard" termination and "For Cause" termination regarding the cost of the exit.', 'extras': {'signature': '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'}}]

## 43. Return and Destruction of Confidential Information

[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'This is a comprehensive, legally robust clause for a Master Services Agreement (MSA), Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), or complex commercial contract. It is designed to be rigorous, covering digital persistence, archival backups, and evidentiary certification.\n\n***\n\n### 43. Return and Destruction of Confidential Information\n\n**43.1. Immediate Obligation upon Termination or Request.** Upon the earlier of: (a) the expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason; or (b) the Disclosing Party’s written request at any time, the Receiving Party shall immediately cease all use of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information and shall, at the Disclosing Party’s sole option and direction, either: (i) promptly return to the Disclosing Party all tangible manifestations of Confidential Information, including all originals, copies, reproductions, and summaries thereof; or (ii) securely destroy all such Confidential Information and all documents, notes, analyses, or other materials prepared by the Receiving Party or its Representatives that contain, reflect, or are derived from such Confidential Information.\n\n**43.2. Scope of Destruction.** The obligation to destroy Confidential Information pursuant to Section 43.1 includes, without limitation, the permanent erasure or "wiping" of all digital, electronic, and magnetic media in the Receiving Party’s possession, custody, or control, ensuring that such information is rendered unrecoverable and incapable of being reconstructed. This includes, but is not limited to, Confidential Information residing on local hard drives, removable media, mobile devices, cloud storage environments, and distributed servers.\n\n**43.3. Archival and Backup Exception.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party may retain copies of Confidential Information to the extent that such information is contained in the Receiving Party’s automated IT backup, disaster recovery, or archival systems; provided, however, that: (a) such retained Confidential Information shall remain subject to the confidentiality and non-use obligations of this Agreement in perpetuity or until such time as the data is overwritten in the ordinary course of the Receiving Party’s data retention policy; (b) the Receiving Party shall not attempt to access, restore, or use such Confidential Information for any purpose; and (c) the Receiving Party shall not be required to manually delete individual files from such automated backup systems if doing so would be technically or commercially impracticable.\n\n**43.4. Legal and Regulatory Retention.** If the Receiving Party is required by applicable law, regulation, or a governmental authority to retain a copy of any Confidential Information for bona fide audit, compliance, or record-keeping purposes, the Receiving Party may retain one (1) copy of such information in a secure, restricted-access environment. The Receiving Party shall provide the Disclosing Party with written notice of the specific information to be retained and the legal basis for such retention. Any information so retained shall remain subject to the terms of this Agreement until such time as the legal or regulatory retention period expires, at which point the destruction obligations under Section 43.1 shall immediately resume.\n\n**43.5. Certification of Compliance.** Within ten (10) business days following the return or destruction of Confidential Information as required herein, an authorized senior officer of the Receiving Party shall execute and deliver to the Disclosing Party a written certificate. This certificate shall formally attest that the Receiving Party has complied with all requirements of this Section 43, that all Confidential Information has been returned or destroyed (subject to the narrow exceptions in Sections 43.3 and 43.4), and that no Confidential Information remains in the possession or control of the Receiving Party or its Representatives.\n\n**43.6. Survival of Obligations.** The return or destruction of Confidential Information shall not release the Receiving Party from its obligations of confidentiality, non-disclosure, and non-use under this Agreement.

[{'type': 'text', 'text': '**44. COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND EXPORT CONTROLS**\n\n**44.1 General Statutory Compliance.** Each Party shall, at its own expense, comply with all applicable international, national, state, provincial, and local laws, statutes, ordinances, regulations, rules, codes, and administrative orders (collectively, "Laws") now or hereafter in effect, including but not limited to those pertaining to data protection, privacy, labor and employment, health and safety, environmental protection, and anti-competitive practices, which are applicable to its performance under this Agreement. A Party’s failure to comply with any Law that results in a material adverse effect on its ability to perform its obligations hereunder shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement.\n\n**44.2 Export Control and Economic Sanctions Compliance.** The Parties acknowledge that the goods, software, technology, technical data, and services (collectively, "Items") provided under this Agreement may be subject to the export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations of the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, and other applicable jurisdictions. These include, without limitation:\n(a) The Export Administration Regulations ("EAR") administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security ("BIS"); \n(b) The International Traffic in Arms Regulations ("ITAR") administered by the U.S. Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls ("DDTC"); \n(c) Economic sanctions programs administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC"); and \n(d) Any applicable laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which the Items are produced, exported, imported, or utilized.\n\n**44.3 Prohibited Transactions and Denied Parties.** Each Party represents and warrants that it is not, and is not owned or controlled by, any person or entity that is: (i) the subject or target of any economic or financial sanctions or trade embargoes administered by OFAC, the U.S. Department of State, the United Nations Security Council, the European Union, or Her Majesty’s Treasury; or (ii) identified on the "Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons" list, the "Entity List," or the "Denied Persons List" (collectively, "Restricted Party Lists"). Neither Party shall, directly or indirectly, export, re-export, transfer, or release any Items to any destination, person, or entity prohibited by Law or the aforementioned Restricted Party Lists without first obtaining all required governmental authorizations.\n\n**44.4 Authorizations and Documentation.** Each Party shall be responsible for obtaining, at its own expense, all necessary licenses, permits, and governmental authorizations required for its own performance. Each Party agrees to provide the other Party with all information and assistance reasonably requested to determine the scope of applicable Export Laws, including the provision of Export Control Classification Numbers ("ECCN"), Harmonized Tariff Schedule ("HTS") codes, and Country of Origin ("COO") certifications. Neither Party shall be required to perform any obligation under this Agreement if such performance would violate any applicable Export Laws or result in the imposition of sanctions.\n\n**44.5 Anti-Corruption and Anti-Bribery.** In connection with its performance under this Agreement, each Party represents and warrants that it has not, and shall not, offer, promise, give, authorize, solicit, or accept any undue pecuniary or other advantage (including "facilitation payments") to or from any Government Official or private party in violation of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"), the UK Bribery Act 2010, or any other applicable anti-corruption legislation. For the purposes of this Section, "Government Official" includes any officer or employee of a government or any department, agency, or instrumentality thereof, or of a public international organization, or any person acting in an official capacity for or on behalf of any such government or department, agency, or instrumentality.\n\n**44.6 Reporting and Audit Rights.** If either Party becomes aware of any actual or potential violation of this Section 44, it shall provide prompt written notice to the other Party. Upon reasonable request and with appropriate confidentiality protections, each Party shall allow the other Party (or its designated independent third-party auditor) to review relevant records to verify compliance with the provisions of this Section.\n\n**44.7 Indemnification and Termination.** Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each Party (the "Indemnifying Party") shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the other Party, its affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, and employees from and against any and all claims, liabilities, fines, penalties, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees) arising out of or related to any breach of the Indemnifying Party’s obligations under this Section 44. Any violation of this Section shall be deemed a non-curable material breach, entitling the non-breaching Party to terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice without any further liability or obligation.

## 45. Force Majeure Events

[{'type': 'text', 'text': '**45. FORCE MAJEURE EVENTS**\n\n**45.1. Definition of Force Majeure.** For the purposes of this Agreement, a "Force Majeure Event" shall mean any act, event, occurrence, or non-occurrence beyond the reasonable control of the party claiming the benefit of this Section (the "Affected Party"), which is unforeseeable at the time of execution of this Agreement, unavoidable in its consequences, and which renders the performance of the Affected Party’s obligations hereunder (other than an obligation for the payment of money) impossible or commercially impracticable. Force Majeure Events shall include, but are not limited to: (a) acts of God, such as severe weather, floods, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or other natural disasters; (b) war, hostilities (whether war be declared or not), invasion, act of foreign enemies, mobilization, or embargo; (c) rebellion, revolution, insurrection, military or usurped power, or civil war; (d) acts of terrorism, sabotage, or civil unrest; (e) epidemic, pandemic, or public health emergencies (including, but not limited to, government-mandated quarantines or lockdowns); (f) ionizing radiation or contamination by radioactivity; (g) national or regional strikes, lockouts, or other industrial labor disputes (provided that such dispute does not involve the workforce of the Affected Party or its subcontractors); and (h) compliance with any sudden change in law, governmental order, rule, regulation, or direction which could not have been anticipated.\n\n**45.2. Exclusions from Force Majeure.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following circumstances shall expressly not constitute a Force Majeure Event: (a) the inability of a party to pay any amounts due hereunder; (b) changes in market conditions, economic hardship, or the exhaustion of financial resources; (c) failure of the Affected Party’s subcontractors or suppliers to perform, unless such failure is itself caused by a Force Majeure Event as defined herein; (d) any act, omission, or negligence of the Affected Party; or (e) mechanical breakdown or failure of equipment, unless caused by an independent Force Majeure Event.\n\n**45.3. Notice Requirements.** As a condition precedent to the suspension of any obligations under this Section, the Affected Party must provide written notice to the other party (the "Non-Affected Party") within five (5) business days of the commencement of the Force Majeure Event. Such notice shall contain: (a) a detailed description of the event; (b) the specific obligations affected; (c) the anticipated duration of the delay; (d) the evidence supporting the claim; and (e) the steps being taken to mitigate the impact of the event. Failure to provide timely notice shall constitute a waiver of the Affected Party\'s right to claim Force Majeure for the period prior to the delivery of such notice.\n\n**45.4. Mitigation and Reasonable Diligence.** Upon the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, the Affected Party shall exercise all commercially reasonable efforts and due diligence to minimize the effects of the event, to find alternative means of performance, and to resume the performance of its obligations as soon as practicable. The Affected Party shall provide the Non-Affected Party with periodic (no less than weekly) updates regarding the status of the event and the efforts being made to resume performance.\n\n**45.5. Suspension of Performance and Extension of Time.** Subject to the notice and mitigation requirements of this Section, the Affected Party’s obligations under this Agreement shall be suspended to the extent that performance is prevented or delayed by the Force Majeure Event. The time for performance of the affected obligations shall be extended by a period equal to the duration of the delay caused by the Force Majeure Event. During the period of suspension, the Non-Affected Party shall be entitled to suspend its own performance of any reciprocal obligations that are dependent upon the Affected Party’s performance.\n\n**45.6. Termination Right.** In the event that a Force Majeure Event continues for a continuous period exceeding ninety (90) calendar days, or for an aggregate of one hundred twenty (120) calendar days within any twelve-month period, the Non-Affected Party may, at its sole discretion, terminate this Agreement upon ten (10) days’ written notice to the Affected Party. In the event of such termination, the parties shall remain liable for all obligations and liabilities accrued prior to the date of the Force Majeure Event, but neither party shall be liable for any damages, penalties, or termination fees solely arising from the termination under this Section.\n\n**45.7. Financial Obligations.** For the avoidance of doubt, no Force Majeure Event shall excuse, delay, or otherwise affect any party’s obligation to pay any sum of money due and owing to the other party prior to the occurrence of the Force Majeure Event, nor shall it excuse the payment of fees for services rendered or goods delivered despite the occurrence of such event.', 'extras': {'signature': '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'}}]

## 46. Governing Law and Venue

[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'This is a comprehensive, "gold-standard" legal clause suitable for high-stakes commercial agreements, master service agreements (MSAs), or complex international contracts. It is designed to be "bulletproof" by addressing choice of law, venue selection, jurisdiction, service of process, and the waiver of jury trials.\n\n***\n\n### 46. Governing Law and Venue\n\n**46.1 Governing Law.** This Agreement, and all claims, disputes, or causes of action (whether in contract, tort, or statute) that may be based upon, arise out of, or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution, or performance of this Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or related to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement), shall be governed by, and enforced in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of **[Insert State, e.g., Delaware]**, including its statutes of limitations, without regard to any borrowing statute or any principles of conflicts of laws that would result in the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. The parties hereby expressly agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) shall not apply to this Agreement or any transactions contemplated hereby.\n\n**46.2 Submission to Jurisdiction.** Each party hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the **[Insert Specific Court, e.g., Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware]** and the United States District Court for the District of **[Insert District]** (and any appellate courts therefrom) in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Each party agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.\n\n**46.3 Waiver of Venue and Forum Non Conveniens.** Each party hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in the courts referred to in Section 46.2. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the defense of an inconvenient forum (forum non conveniens) to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court and further waives any right to move for a transfer of venue.\n\n**46.4 Service of Process.** Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section **[Insert Section Number for Notices]** of this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law. The parties agree that failure to receive such notice shall not affect the validity of such service or the jurisdiction of the court.\n\n**46.5 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT, OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.**\n\n**46.6 Specific Performance.** The parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.\n\n***\n\n### Key Elements of this Text:\n*   **The "Internal Laws" Provision:** Prevents a court from applying "conflict of laws" rules that might lead back to another state\'s laws.\n*   **Broad Scope:** Covers not just the contract, but also torts (like fraud) and the negotiation phase.\n*   **CISG Exclusion:** Vital for international trade to ensure local law applies, not international treaty.\n*   **Forum Non Conveniens Waiver:** Prevents a party from trying to move the case by arguing the chosen location is "inconvenient."\n*   **Conspicuous Jury Waiver:** Required by many jurisdictions to be in **BOLD AND ALL CAPS** to be legally enforceable.\n*   **Equitable Relief:** Explicitly mentions "Specific Performance," allowing a party to ask the court to force the other party to act, rather than just paying damages.', 'extras': {'signature': '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'}}]

## 47. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration

[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'This is a comprehensive, "gold-standard" legal provision for a commercial agreement. It is designed to be self-executing, protective of corporate interests, and rigorous in its procedural requirements.\n\n***\n\n### 47. DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND ARBITRATION\n\n**47.1. Mandatory Informal Resolution.** In the event of any controversy, claim, or dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof (collectively, a "Dispute"), the parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute through direct negotiations. Either party may initiate this process by delivering a written "Notice of Dispute" to the other party. Within fifteen (15) business days of receipt of said Notice, authorized representatives of each party with decision-making authority shall meet (via video conference or in person) to attempt a resolution. If the Dispute is not resolved within thirty (30) days of the initial meeting, either party may proceed to mediation as set forth in Section 47.2.\n\n**47.2. Mediation.** Subject to the informal resolution process in Section 47.1, any Dispute that remains unresolved shall be submitted to non-binding mediation before a single mediator. The mediation shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its Commercial Mediation Procedures then in effect. The parties shall cooperate with the AAA and with one another in selecting a mediator from the AAA panel of neutrals and in scheduling the mediation proceedings. The parties agree that they will participate in the mediation in good faith and that they will share equally in its costs. All offers, promises, conduct, and statements, whether oral or written, made in the course of the mediation by any of the parties, their agents, employees, experts, and attorneys, and by the mediator or any AAA employees, are confidential, privileged, and inadmissible for any purpose, including impeachment, in any arbitration or other proceeding involving the parties, provided that evidence that is otherwise admissible or discoverable shall not be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable as a result of its use in the mediation.\n\n**47.3. Binding Arbitration.** If the Dispute is not resolved through mediation within sixty (60) days of the appointment of the mediator, or such further period as the parties may agree in writing, such Dispute shall be settled by final and binding arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted by JAMS (or alternatively the AAA if JAMS is unavailable) pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the "Rules") then in effect, except as modified herein. \n\n*   **(a) Arbitrator Selection and Qualifications.** The arbitration shall be heard by a single neutral arbitrator, unless the amount in controversy exceeds five million dollars ($5,000,000.00) USD, in which case the Dispute shall be heard by a panel of three (3) arbitrators. Any arbitrator appointed shall be a retired judge or an attorney with at least twenty (20) years of active experience in commercial litigation and substantial expertise in the subject matter of this Agreement.\n*   **(b) Venue and Language.** The seat and venue of the arbitration shall be [City, State/Country], unless the parties mutually agree otherwise in writing. The proceedings shall be conducted English.\n*   **(c) Discovery.** The parties shall be entitled to reasonable discovery, including the exchange of relevant, non-privileged documents and a limited number of depositions, as determined by the arbitrator(s) in accordance with the expedited nature of arbitration.\n*   **(d) Award.** The arbitrator(s) shall issue a reasoned written award stating the essential findings and conclusions upon which the award is based. The award shall be final and binding on the parties. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction.\n\n**47.4. Class Action and Jury Trial Waiver.** THE PARTIES HERETO WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO ASSERT ANY CLAIM AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY AS A REPRESENTATIVE OR MEMBER IN ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, EXCEPT WHERE SUCH WAIVER IS PROHIBITED BY LAW OR DEEMED UNENFORCEABLE. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE PARTIES FURTHER WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A TRIAL BY JURY. ALL DISPUTES SHALL BE RESOLVED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. The arbitrator(s) may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.\n\n**47.5. Provisional Remedies and Injunctive Relief.** Notwithstanding the mandatory arbitration provisions herein, either party may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for interim or conservatory measures, including but not limited to temporary restraining orders or preliminary injunctions, to prevent irreparable harm (such as the unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information or infringement of Intellectual Property Rights). The application for such measures shall not be deemed a waiver of the agreement to arbitrate.\n\n**47.6. Governing Law.** This Section 47 shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16), notwithstanding any other choice of law provision in this Agreement. The substantive law governing the Dispute shall be the laws of the State of [State], without regard to its conflict of laws principles.\n\n**47.7. Costs and Attorney’s Fees.** The prevailing party in any arbitration or authorized court action arising out of this Agreement shall be entitled to recover from the non-prevailing party all reasonable costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney\'s fees, expert witness fees, and administrative filing fees.\n\n**47.8. Confidentiality of Proceedings.** The parties, their representatives, and the arbitrator(s) shall hold the existence, content, and result of the arbitration in confidence, except as may be required by law or for the purposes of enforcement or challenging the award in a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\n**47.9. Severability of Arbitration Clause.** If any part of this Section 47 is found to be unenforceable or invalid by a court or arbitrator, the remaining portions of this Section shall remain in full force and effect.

## 48. Assignment and Subcontracting

[{'type': 'text', 'text': 'This text is drafted for use in a high-stakes commercial agreement, such as a Master Services Agreement (MSA), a complex construction contract, or a technology licensing agreement. It is designed to be restrictive, protective of the non-assigning party, and exhaustive in its scope.\n\n***\n\n### 48. Assignment and Subcontracting\n\n**48.1 General Prohibition.** Except as expressly provided in this Section 48, neither Party may assign, delegate, subcontract, mortgage, charge, declare a trust over, or otherwise transfer or dispose of any of its rights, duties, or obligations under this Agreement, whether by operation of law, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other Party. Any such consent may be withheld, delayed, or conditioned at the non-requesting Party’s absolute and sole discretion. Any attempted assignment, delegation, or subcontracting in violation of this Section 48.1 shall be deemed *null and void ab initio* and shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement.\n\n**48.2 Permitted Assignments.** Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 48.1, either Party (the “Assignor”) may, upon no less than thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to the other Party, assign this Agreement in its entirety to: (a) an Affiliate of the Assignor; or (b) a successor-in-interest in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or the sale of all or substantially all of the Assignor’s assets or equity related to the subject matter of this Agreement; provided, however, that:\n> (i) the proposed assignee or successor expressly assumes in writing all of the Assignor’s obligations and liabilities under this Agreement;\n> (ii) the proposed assignee possesses the financial, technical, and operational capacity to perform the obligations hereunder, as evidenced by documentation reasonably satisfactory to the non-assigning Party;\n> (iii) such assignment does not result in a conflict of interest or violate any applicable laws, including export control regulations or anti-sanctions regimes; and\n> (iv) the Assignor remains primary and solidarily liable for the performance of all obligations under this Agreement unless the non-assigning Party expressly releases the Assignor in writing.\n\n**48.3 Change of Control.** For the purposes of this Section 48, any Change of Control of a Party shall be deemed an assignment requiring the prior written consent of the other Party. A “Change of Control” shall mean (a) the sale, lease, or transfer of substantially all of the assets of a Party; (b) a merger, reorganization, or consolidation in which the Party is not the surviving entity; or (c) the transfer, in one or a series of related transactions, of more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting power or equity interests of such Party to an unrelated third party.\n\n**48.4 Subcontracting.** \n> **48.4.1 Approval Process.** The Contractor [or Provider] shall not subcontract any portion of the Services or its obligations under this Agreement without the prior written approval of the Client. The Contractor shall provide the Client with detailed information regarding the proposed subcontractor’s identity, qualifications, financial standing, and the specific scope of the work to be delegated. \n> \n> **48.4.2 Responsibility for Subcontractors.** The Contractor shall remain fully and primary responsible for the acts, omissions, defaults, and negligence of its subcontractors, their agents, and employees, as if they were the acts, omissions, defaults, or negligence of the Contractor itself. No subcontracting arrangement shall relieve the Contractor of any of its liabilities or obligations under this Agreement.\n> \n> **48.4.3 Flow-Down Provisions.** The Contractor shall ensure that any agreement with a permitted subcontractor contains provisions that are at least as protective of the Client’s rights as those set forth in this Agreement, including but not limited to provisions regarding Confidentiality (Section [X]), Intellectual Property Rights (Section [Y]), Indemnification (Section [Z]), Data Protection, and Audit Rights. Upon request, the Contractor shall provide the Client with redacted copies of such subcontracts to verify compliance with this Section.\n\n**48.5 Right to Direct Discharge.** In the event that a subcontractor asserts a claim or lien against the Client arising out of the Contractor’s failure to compensate said subcontractor, the Client shall have the right, after providing five (5) days’ notice to the Contractor, to pay such subcontractor directly and offset any such payments, including legal fees and administrative costs, against any sums due to the Contractor under this Agreement.\n\n**48.6 Binding Effect.** This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective permitted successors and authorized assigns. Nothing in this Section 48 shall be construed as creating any third-party beneficiary rights except as expressly set forth herein.\n\n**48.7 No Release.** No assignment or subcontracting, whether permitted or consented to, shall operate as a novation or release the assigning or subcontracting Party from its obligation to ensure the full and timely performance of this Agreement, unless a formal written release is executed by the other Party.', 'extras': {'signature': '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'}}]

## 50. Entire Agreement, Severability, and Counterparts

[{'type': 'text', 'text': '**50. ENTIRE AGREEMENT, SEVERABILITY, AND COUNTERPARTS**\n\n**50.1 Entire Agreement and Integration.** This Agreement, including all recitals, exhibits, schedules, annexes, and any executed Statements of Work or Addenda attached hereto or incorporated herein by reference, constitutes the sole, final, and exclusive expression of the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. This instrument supersedes, terminates, and replaces any and all prior or contemporaneous oral or written understandings, negotiations, commitments, representations, warranties, promises, conditions, or collateral agreements between the Parties relating to the same subject matter, including but not limited to any letters of intent, memoranda of understanding, or preliminary term sheets. Each Party acknowledges and represents that, in executing this Agreement, it has not relied upon any statement, representation, warranty, or covenant (whether express or implied) made by the other Party or any person acting on behalf of the other Party, except for those expressly set forth in this Agreement. No trade usage, course of performance, or course of dealing between the Parties shall be used to interpret, supplement, or modify the terms herein.\n\n**50.2 Severability and Reformation.** If any term, provision, covenant, or condition of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or an arbitral tribunal to be invalid, void, illegal, or unenforceable under applicable law, such provision shall be deemed modified to the minimum extent necessary to render it valid and enforceable while preserving, to the maximum extent possible, the original intent and economic effect of the Parties. If such modification is not legally possible, the offending provision shall be severed from this Agreement, and the remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect without being impaired or invalidated in any way. The Parties further agree that if any provision is held unenforceable due to its scope, duration, or geographic breadth, such provision shall be deemed "blue-penciled" and reformed by the adjudicating body to encompass the maximum scope, duration, or breadth permitted by law.\n\n**50.3 Counterparts and Execution.** This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. A signature to this Agreement delivered via facsimile, scanned PDF attachment to email, or through a verified electronic signature platform (including but not limited to DocuSign or Adobe Sign) shall be deemed an original signature and shall have the same full force and legal effect as a handwritten "wet ink" signature. No Party shall contest the admissibility of this Agreement or any counterpart thereof on the basis that it was signed or delivered electronically, and the Parties hereby waive any rights under the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA), the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-SIGN), or any similar state or international legislation to challenge the validity of this Agreement based solely on its electronic execution.\n\n**50.4 Amendments and Waivers.** No supplement, modification, or amendment of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by a duly authorized representative of each Party. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and signed by the Party against whom the waiver is sought to be enforced. A waiver of any breach or default shall not constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default, nor shall any delay or omission on the part of either Party to exercise or avail itself of any right or remedy operate as a waiver of that or any other right or remedy.', 'extras': {'signature': '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'}}]
