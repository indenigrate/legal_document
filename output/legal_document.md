## Authorized Users and Access Credentials Management

Section [X]. AUTHORIZED USERS AND ACCESS CREDENTIALS MANAGEMENT. Customer shall be strictly limited to providing access to and use of the Services to those specific individuals whom the Customer has explicitly authorized to use the Services and who are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those contained herein (“Authorized Users”). The Customer is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of all access credentials, including but not limited to usernames, passwords, tokens, digital certificates, and API keys (collectively, “Access Credentials”), and shall ensure that all Authorized Users do not disclose such Access Credentials to any third party or unauthorized individual.

Provider shall have no liability for any loss or damage arising from Customer’s failure to comply with the requirements of this Section.

To be eligible for participation, the Affiliate represents and warrants that it is a legal entity or an individual of at least eighteen (18) years of age, possessing the full legal capacity and authority to enter into this Agreement. The Company reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to reject any application for enrollment or to terminate an existing Affiliate’s participation at any time, with or without cause, including but not limited to instances where the Affiliate’s promotional methods, content, or business practices are deemed incompatible with the Company’s brand image, reputation, or legal obligations.

7.2 Limited License Grant. Subject to the Affiliate’s strict compliance with the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Company hereby grants to the Affiliate a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable, royalty-free license to display and use the Company’s approved trademarks, service marks, logos, brand names, and copyrighted marketing materials (collectively, the "Company Assets") solely for the purpose of identifying the Affiliate as a participant in the Affiliate Program and for directing prospective customers to the Company’s platform via designated affiliate links. This license is strictly limited to the duration of the Affiliate’s active participation in the Program and shall automatically terminate upon the expiration or termination of this Agreement.

All use of Company Assets must adhere to the Company’s most current brand guidelines.

Furthermore, the Affiliate is strictly prohibited from: (i) registering, bidding on, or utilizing search engine keywords, domain names, or social media handles that are identical or confusingly similar to the Company’s trademarks; (ii) using the Company Assets on any website or platform that contains defamatory, obscene, violent, or illegal content; and (iii) employing any deceptive marketing practices, including "cookie stuffing" or unauthorized pop-up advertisements.

## SaaS Platform Availability and Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

8. SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT AND PLATFORM AVAILABILITY

8.1 Service Level Commitment. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Provider shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the SaaS Platform is Available (as defined below) to the Client with a Monthly Uptime Percentage of at least 99.9% during any calendar month (the "Service Level Commitment").

8.2 Definitions and Calculation.
(a) "Availability" or "Available" shall mean that the Client is able to log into the SaaS Platform and access the core functional modules thereof, excluding any unavailability resulting from Excused Downtime.
(b) "Monthly Uptime Percentage" is calculated by dividing the total number of minutes in a calendar month, minus the total number of minutes of Downtime in said month, by the total number of minutes in that month.
(c) "Downtime" means the total accumulated minutes during a calendar month during which the SaaS Platform is not Available. Downtime does not include any period of non-availability resulting from Excused Downtime.
(d) "Excused Downtime" means any period of unavailability, suspension, or termination of the SaaS Platform performance that is caused by: (i) Scheduled Maintenance; (ii) Emergency Maintenance; (iii) Force Majeure events; (iv) outages or malfunctions of the Client’s internal network, hardware, or third-party internet service providers; (v) unauthorized or improper use of the SaaS Platform by the Client or any User; (vi) failure of third-party applications, APIs, or integrations not within the Provider’s direct control; or (vii) suspension of the Service by the Provider pursuant to the terms of this Agreement due to the Client’s breach of its obligations, including non-payment of fees.

8.3 Maintenance Windows.
(a) Scheduled Maintenance. The Provider reserves the right to perform routine system maintenance, upgrades, and infrastructure testing ("Scheduled Maintenance"). The Provider shall utilize commercially reasonable efforts to perform Scheduled Maintenance during periods of low system utilization. The Provider shall provide the Client with at least forty-eight (48) hours’ prior electronic notice of any Scheduled Maintenance expected to result in an interruption of Service.
(b) Emergency Maintenance. The Provider may, at its sole discretion, perform maintenance at any time to address critical security vulnerabilities, unforeseen hardware failures, or other emergencies that pose an immediate risk to the SaaS Platform or Client Data ("Emergency Maintenance"). The Provider shall provide such notice as is reasonably practicable under the circumstances.

8.4 Service Credits.
(a) In the event the Provider fails to achieve the Service Level Commitment, the Client shall be entitled to request a credit against the next applicable invoice ("Service Credit"). Service Credits shall be calculated as a percentage of the pro-rated monthly subscription fee for the affected calendar month as follows:
(i) Monthly Uptime < 99.9% but ≥ 99.0%: 5% Service Credit.
(ii) Monthly Uptime < 99.0% but ≥ 97.0%: 10% Service Credit.
(iii) Monthly Uptime < 97.0%: 20% Service Credit.
(b) The aggregate maximum Service Credit for any single calendar month shall not exceed 20% of the monthly subscription fee attributable to that month. Service Credits are non-refundable, hold no cash value, and may only be applied toward future fees owed to the Provider.

8.5 Claim and Notification Procedure. To be eligible for a Service Credit, the Client must submit a written claim to the Provider’s support department within fifteen (15) calendar days following the end of the month in which the Service Level Commitment was allegedly not met. The claim must include a detailed description of the Downtime, including the dates, times, and duration of the unavailability. If the Monthly Uptime Percentage is confirmed by the Provider’s system logs and monitoring tools to be below the Service Level Commitment, the Provider shall issue the Service Credit within one billing cycle following the approval of the claim. Failure to comply with these notification requirements shall forfeit the Client’s right to receive a Service Credit.

8.6 Sole and Exclusive Remedy. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PROVISION TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE SERVICE CREDITS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 8 REPRESENT THE CLIENT’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY, AND THE PROVIDER’S ENTIRE AND TOTAL LIABILITY, FOR ANY FAILURE BY THE PROVIDER TO MEET THE SERVICE LEVEL COMMITMENT, OR FOR ANY OTHER UNAVAILABILITY, DELAY, OR INTERRUPTION OF THE SAAS PLATFORM.

## Scheduled Maintenance and Emergency Downtime

SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE AND EMERGENCY DOWNTIME

1.1 Scheduled Maintenance. The Provider reserves the right to periodically suspend access to the Services, or any specific component or functionality thereof, for the purpose of performing necessary maintenance, system updates, software patches, infrastructure repairs, or hardware replacements (“Scheduled Maintenance”). The Provider shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to conduct Scheduled Maintenance during windows of traditionally low system usage. The Provider shall endeavor to provide the Client with no less than forty-eight (48) hours’ prior notice of any such Scheduled Maintenance via the Provider’s administrative portal, electronic mail to the designated account administrator, or another recognized communication channel. The Client acknowledges that while the Provider strives to adhere to such notice periods, operational exigencies may occasionally necessitate the alteration of scheduled windows.

1.2 Emergency Downtime. Notwithstanding the notice provisions set forth in Section 1.1, the Provider may, in its sole and absolute discretion, initiate an immediate suspension of the Services, without prior notice to the Client, if such suspension is deemed necessary to protect the integrity, security, or stability of the Services, the Provider’s network, or the proprietary data of the Provider or its other clients (“Emergency Downtime”). Circumstances justifying Emergency Downtime include, but are not limited to, the mitigation of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, the application of critical security patches to address zero-day vulnerabilities, the resolution of catastrophic hardware or telecommunications failures, or compliance with urgent legal, judicial, or regulatory mandates requiring the immediate cessation of operations. The Provider shall notify the Client of the nature and expected duration of the Emergency Downtime as soon as is reasonably practicable under the circumstances.

1.3 Limitation of Liability and Exclusions. The Client expressly acknowledges and agrees that the Services are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis and that the Provider does not warrant that the Services will be uninterrupted or error-free. Any period of unavailability resulting from Scheduled Maintenance or Emergency Downtime shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement, nor shall it entitle the Client to any credits, refunds, set-offs, or liquidated damages, except as specifically stipulated in a separate, validly executed Service Level Agreement (SLA) incorporated herein by reference. Under no circumstances shall the Provider, its affiliates, or its third-party service providers be held liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or exemplary damages—including, without limitation, loss of revenue, loss of profits, loss of data, or business interruption—arising out of or in connection with the suspension of Services pursuant to this Section. The Client remains solely responsible for implementing adequate contingency plans and data redundancy measures to mitigate the impact of any service interruptions. All obligations of the Provider under this Section are subject to the Force Majeure provisions contained elsewhere in this Agreement.

## Platform Updates, Upgrades, and Modifications

PLATFORM UPDATES, UPGRADES, AND MODIFICATIONS

The Company reserves the right, at its sole and absolute discretion, to modify, enhance, supplement, update, upgrade, or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any feature, functionality, tool, or aspect of the Platform at any time and without prior notice to the User. Such modifications may include, without limitation, the introduction of new software modules, the removal of deprecated features, the implementation of security patches, bug fixes, and alterations to the user interface or underlying technical architecture. 

The User acknowledges and agrees that the Company may, from time to time, deploy automatic updates to the Platform, which may be installed on the User’s device or system without additional consent or notification. The User hereby grants the Company permission to deliver such updates automatically as part of the User’s continued use of the Platform. The Company shall have no obligation to provide any specific updates or to ensure that any particular version of the Platform remains compatible with any hardware, operating system, or third-party software.

The Company further reserves the right to establish or modify the minimum system requirements necessary to access and utilize the Platform. It is the User’s sole responsibility to ensure that their hardware, software, and internet connectivity meet these requirements. The User acknowledges that failure to install or permit the installation of updates, or to maintain a compatible operating environment, may result in impaired functionality, security vulnerabilities, or the total inability to access the Platform.

The Company shall not be liable to the User or any third party for any loss, damage, or inconvenience resulting from any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of the Platform or any part thereof. While the Company will make reasonable efforts to maintain the integrity of User data during the update process, the Company does not guarantee that such updates will be error-free or that existing settings, configurations, or preferences will be preserved. The User is strongly encouraged to maintain independent backups of any critical data associated with their use of the Platform. 

Nothing in this Section shall be construed as an obligation for the Company to provide any maintenance, support, or technical assistance unless otherwise expressly provided in a separate written agreement. All updates, upgrades, and modifications provided under this Section shall be subject to the same terms, conditions, and limitations of liability set forth in this Agreement. Continued use of the Platform following any such update or modification constitutes the User’s irrevocable acceptance of the modified Platform.

## Implementation, Onboarding, and Training Services

Section [X]. IMPLEMENTATION, ONBOARDING, AND TRAINING SERVICES

[X].1 Scope of Professional Services. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the payment of all applicable fees, the Company shall provide the Customer with certain implementation, configuration, onboarding, and training services (collectively, the "Professional Services") as specifically delineated in a mutually executed Statement of Work ("SOW") or an applicable Order Form. Each SOW shall constitute a separate, legally binding agreement incorporating the terms of this Agreement by reference. In the event of a direct conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the provisions of an SOW, the terms of the SOW shall prevail solely with respect to the specific Professional Services described therein.

[X].2 Implementation and Onboarding. The Company shall utilize commercially reasonable efforts to execute the implementation and onboarding activities in accordance with the project schedules, milestones, and technical specifications set forth in the SOW. The Company’s performance and the adherence to any projected timelines are strictly contingent upon the Customer’s timely delivery of all required data, system access, and organizational cooperation. The Customer shall appoint a dedicated project manager with the requisite authority to serve as the primary point of contact for all implementation activities and to facilitate internal coordination.

[X].3 Customer Obligations and Cooperation. The Customer acknowledges and agrees that the successful and timely completion of the Professional Services requires the full, proactive, and good faith cooperation of the Customer and its personnel. Customer shall: (a) provide the Company with such information, data, and materials as may be reasonably required for the performance of the services; (b) provide timely access to Customer’s facilities, cloud environments, hardware, and software systems as necessary; (c) ensure that Customer’s technical environment meets the minimum specifications and compatibility requirements provided by the Company; and (d) perform any Customer-specific tasks identified as "Customer Responsibilities" in the SOW. Any delay in the performance of the Professional Services resulting from the Customer’s failure to fulfill its obligations, or any delay requested by the Customer (each a "Customer Delay"), shall excuse the Company’s performance for the duration of such delay and may, at the Company’s discretion, result in additional fees, administrative charges, or adjustments to the project timeline.

[X].4 Acceptance and Testing. Upon completion of specific milestones or the final delivery of implementation services, the Company shall notify the Customer that the Professional Services are ready for review. The Customer shall have five (5) business days (the "Review Period") to evaluate the services against the acceptance criteria set forth in the SOW. If the Customer identifies a material non-conformity, it must provide detailed written notice to the Company prior to the expiration of the Review Period, specifying the nature of the deficiency with sufficient detail to allow the Company to replicate the issue. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to remediate such deficiency, after which the Review Period shall reset for the modified portion. If no written notice of deficiency is provided within the Review Period, or if the Customer utilizes the implemented Solution in a live production environment or for any commercial purpose, the Professional Services shall be deemed irrevocably accepted.

[X].5 Training Services. The Company shall provide training sessions as specified in the SOW or Order Form, which may be delivered via remote digital platform or on-site at a Customer location, as expressly agreed upon by the parties. Unless otherwise specified, all training credits, vouchers, or sessions must be utilized within ninety (90) days of the Effective Date or the commencement of the implementation phase, whichever occurs later; any unused training sessions remaining after such period shall expire without refund, credit, or carry-over. Training materials provided by the Company, including manuals, videos, and documentation, constitute the proprietary Intellectual Property of the Company. The Customer is granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use such materials solely for its internal business purposes and for the training of its authorized users during the Term.

[X].6 Change Management and Scope Modifications. Any modification to the scope, nature, or volume of Professional Services, including changes to timelines, deliverables, or technical requirements, must be documented in a written "Change Order" signed by authorized representatives of both parties. The Company shall not be obligated to perform any services outside the scope of the original SOW until a Change Order has been fully executed. Such Change Orders may involve adjustments to the fees, expenses, and delivery schedules.

[X].7 Personnel and Performance Warranty. The Company shall retain absolute discretion over the assignment, replacement, or reassignment of its personnel or subcontractors performing the Professional Services. The Company warrants that the Professional Services shall be performed in a professional and workmanlike manner consistent with prevailing industry standards. The Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy, and the Company’s entire liability for a breach of this warranty, shall be the re-performance of the non-conforming services at no additional cost to the Customer, provided that the Customer notifies the Company of such breach in writing within thirty (30) days of the performance of the applicable services.

[X].8 Expenses and Reimbursement. Unless otherwise expressly stated as a fixed-fee arrangement inclusive of expenses in the SOW, the Customer shall reimburse the Company for all reasonable, pre-approved, out-of-pocket travel and incidental expenses (including airfare, lodging, and per diem) incurred by the Company’s personnel in connection with the performance of on-site Professional Services. Such expenses shall be invoiced monthly in arrears and shall be payable in accordance with the standard payment terms set forth in this Agreement.

## Professional Services and Statement of Work (SOW) Process

Section X. PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AND STATEMENTS OF WORK

X.1 Scope of Services. From time to time, Client may engage Company to perform certain professional, technical, consulting, or other services (the “Services”) as described in one or more mutually executed statements of work (each, a “Statement of Work” or “SOW”). Each Statement of Work shall be governed by the terms and conditions of this Agreement and shall be deemed incorporated herein by reference. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement and any SOW, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail, unless the SOW expressly states that it is intended to supersede a specific provision of this Agreement for that particular engagement, referencing the section number of this Agreement to be superseded.

X.2 SOW Formation and Execution. No SOW shall be binding upon the parties until it is executed by an authorized representative of each party. Each SOW shall, at a minimum, set forth: (a) a detailed description of the Services and any associated deliverables (the “Deliverables”); (b) the projected commencement and completion dates or specific milestones; (c) the applicable fee structure (e.g., time and materials, fixed price, or milestone-based) and payment schedule; (d) any specific technical specifications or acceptance criteria; and (e) any responsibilities or dependencies required of the Client.

X.3 Change Control Procedure. Either party may, at any time, request a change to the scope, specifications, or timing of the Services or Deliverables defined in an active SOW. All such requests shall be managed through a formal change control process. Company shall evaluate the impact of the requested change on the fees, schedule, and resources, and provide Client with a written description of such impacts. No change shall be effective or binding until the parties execute a written change order (a “Change Order”). Until a Change Order is fully executed, Company shall continue to perform the Services in accordance with the then-current SOW, and Client shall remain liable for all fees and expenses incurred thereunder.

X.4 Personnel and Performance. Company shall exercise sole discretion in determining the personnel, including employees and permitted subcontractors, assigned to perform the Services. Company warrants that it shall perform the Services in a professional and workmanlike manner, in accordance with generally recognized industry standards for similar services. Client’s sole and exclusive remedy for a breach of this limited warranty shall be the re-performance of the deficient Services by Company, provided that Client notifies Company in writing of such deficiency within thirty (30) days of the performance of the non-conforming Services.

X.5 Client Obligations and Dependencies. Client acknowledges that Company’s timely and successful performance of the Services is strictly contingent upon Client’s timely and effective performance of its responsibilities and the accuracy of information provided by Client. Client shall: (a) provide Company with reasonable and timely access to Client’s facilities, equipment, data, and personnel as necessary; (b) designate a project manager with the authority to make decisions and provide approvals on behalf of Client; and (c) perform any specific tasks or provide any specific materials identified as Client dependencies in the SOW. Any delay or failure by Client to fulfill its obligations shall be deemed a “Client Delay.” In the event of a Client Delay, Company shall be entitled to an equitable adjustment in the performance schedule and may, at its discretion, increase the fees to reflect any additional costs or resource idling incurred as a result of such delay.

X.6 Deliverables and Acceptance. Upon delivery of a Deliverable, Client shall have a period of five (5) business days, or such other period as defined in the SOW (the “Review Period”), to evaluate the Deliverable solely for material compliance with the specifications set forth in the applicable SOW. If the Deliverable fails to conform in a material respect, Client shall provide Company with a detailed written notice of non-conformance prior to the expiration of the Review Period. Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to remediate the non-conformance and resubmit the Deliverable for review. If Client fails to provide written notice of non-conformance within the Review Period, or if Client uses the Deliverable in a live production environment or for any commercial purpose, the Deliverable shall be deemed irrevocably accepted.

X.7 Fees and Expenses. Client shall pay Company the fees specified in the SOW. Unless otherwise stated in the SOW, all Services provided on a time and materials basis shall be billed monthly in arrears. In addition to the fees, Client shall reimburse Company for all reasonable, pre-approved out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the performance of the Services, including but not limited to travel, lodging, and meal expenses, subject to Company’s provision of standard supporting documentation. All fees and expenses are non-refundable and shall be paid in accordance with the payment terms set forth in this Agreement.

## Technical Support and Incident Response

TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND INCIDENT RESPONSE

1. Scope of Support Services. During the Term of this Agreement, and subject to the Client’s continued compliance with all financial and contractual obligations herein, the Provider shall furnish technical support services (“Support Services”) intended to facilitate the operational maintenance and error correction of the Licensed Services. Support Services shall be restricted to the identification and remediation of "Errors," defined strictly as a verifiable and reproducible failure of the Services to conform in material respects to the functional specifications set forth in the Documentation. Support Services do not include onsite assistance, hardware maintenance, support for third-party integrations not authored by the Provider, or remediation of issues arising from the Client’s internal network configuration.

2. Incident Classification and Response Protocols. Upon receipt of an incident report submitted through the Provider’s designated support portal or authorized communication channels, the Provider shall categorize the incident based on its impact on the Client’s business operations. 

(a) Severity Level 1 (Critical): A total loss of functionality of the Services or a critical security breach resulting in unauthorized data exfiltration. The Provider will initiate continuous efforts during business hours to provide a workaround or permanent fix. 
(b) Severity Level 2 (High): Significant degradation of essential functions where no immediate workaround exists. The Provider will assign qualified personnel to commence remediation within the timeframe specified in the applicable Service Level Agreement (SLA). 
(c) Severity Level 3 (Medium): Partial loss of non-critical functionality or intermittent performance issues. 
(d) Severity Level 4 (Low): General inquiries, cosmetic defects, or documentation errors. 

The Provider’s obligation is limited to "Response Times"—defined as the interval between the initial logging of a valid support ticket and the first substantive acknowledgement by a support technician—and does not constitute a guarantee of "Resolution Time," given the inherent complexities of software debugging and environment-specific variables.

3. Incident Response and Security Breach. In the event of a "Security Incident," defined as a confirmed unauthorized access to or acquisition of Client Data maintained on the Provider’s infrastructure, the Provider shall activate its Incident Response Plan (IRP). The Provider shall notify the Client without undue delay, and in any event within the periods mandated by applicable data protection laws, following definitive confirmation of such breach. The Provider’s response shall include (i) containment and mitigation of the impact, (ii) forensic investigation into the root cause, and (iii) regular updates to the Client regarding remediation status. The Provider’s liability for security incidents is strictly governed by the Limitation of Liability section of this Agreement.

4. Client Obligations and Cooperation. The Client acknowledges that the Provider’s ability to deliver Support Services is contingent upon the Client’s timely and full cooperation. The Client shall (i) provide detailed descriptions of the Error, including log files, screenshots, and steps to reproduce; (ii) designate a qualified technical point of contact authorized to implement instructions provided by the Provider; and (iii) grant the Provider such remote access to the Client’s environment as is reasonably necessary to perform diagnostics, subject to the Provider’s adherence to the Client’s reasonable security protocols. Failure to provide such cooperation shall relieve the Provider of its support obligations and SLA commitments related to the affected incident.

5. Exclusions. The Provider shall have no obligation to provide Support Services for issues resulting from: (i) unauthorized modifications, alterations, or repairs to the Services performed by any party other than the Provider; (ii) use of the Services in a manner inconsistent with the Documentation or the Acceptable Use Policy; (iii) failures in the Client’s hardware, local area networks, or internet connectivity; (iv) use of the Services in conjunction with third-party software or hardware not expressly certified as compatible by the Provider; or (v) Force Majeure events. Any services provided by the Provider to remediate excluded issues shall be billed at the Provider’s then-current professional services rates.

6. Limitations. SUPPORT SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION, THE PROVIDER DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE PROVIDER DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SUPPORT SERVICES WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR THAT ALL ERRORS REPORTED BY THE CLIENT WILL BE CORRECTED. THE REMEDIES SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION AND THE ACCOMPANYING SLA CONSTITUTE THE CLIENT’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES FOR ANY FAILURE OF THE PROVIDER TO MEET ITS SUPPORT OR INCIDENT RESPONSE OBLIGATIONS.

## Customer Obligations and Cooperation

CUSTOMER OBLIGATIONS AND COOPERATION

1.1 General Duty of Cooperation. The Customer shall, at all times, act in good faith and provide all reasonable cooperation to the Provider to facilitate the timely and efficient performance of the Services. This includes, without limitation, the provision of such information, data, documentation, and materials as the Provider may reasonably request, and ensuring that such information is accurate, complete, and current in all material respects.

1.2 Appointment of Project Manager. The Customer shall designate a qualified individual to act as its primary point of contact (the "Project Manager") regarding all technical and operational matters related to the Services. The Project Manager shall possess the requisite authority to make binding decisions on behalf of the Customer and shall be available during regular business hours to consult with the Provider, provide necessary approvals, and resolve any disputes or issues that may arise during the term of the Agreement.

1.3 Access to Facilities and Infrastructure. To the extent necessary for the Provider to perform its obligations, the Customer shall grant the Provider’s personnel and subcontractors timely access to the Customer’s premises, office facilities, and technical infrastructure, including but not limited to servers, network configurations, software environments, and databases. The Customer shall ensure that its internal systems meet the minimum technical specifications and compatibility requirements communicated by the Provider.

1.4 Accuracy of Customer Content. The Customer represents and warrants that all data, content, specifications, and intellectual property provided to the Provider (the "Customer Materials") are owned by the Customer or that the Customer has obtained all necessary licenses, consents, and permissions to utilize such materials. The Customer shall be solely responsible for the legality, reliability, integrity, and quality of the Customer Materials and shall indemnify the Provider against any third-party claims arising from the use thereof.

1.5 Compliance with Laws and Regulatory Requirements. The Customer shall comply with all applicable local, state, national, and international laws and regulations in the performance of its obligations under this Agreement, including but not limited to data protection and privacy laws, export control regulations, and anti-corruption statutes. The Customer is responsible for ensuring that its use of the Services complies with any industry-specific regulations or internal compliance policies applicable to its business operations.

1.6 Security and Credentials. The Customer shall maintain the confidentiality and security of all login credentials, API keys, and access protocols provided by the Provider. The Customer shall immediately notify the Provider of any unauthorized use of its accounts or any other breach of security. The Customer shall be held liable for all activities occurring under its account, whether or not authorized, resulting from the Customer’s failure to maintain the confidentiality of its credentials.

1.7 Timely Review and Approvals. Where the Provider requires the Customer’s review, testing, or approval of deliverables, milestones, or work products, the Customer shall provide such feedback or approval within the timeframe specified in the applicable Statement of Work or, if no timeframe is specified, within five (5) business days of the request. The Customer’s failure to provide a timely response shall be deemed an acceptance of the deliverable or a waiver of the right to object, unless otherwise agreed in writing.

1.8 Effect of Customer Delay or Non-Performance. If the Provider's performance of its obligations is prevented, hindered, or delayed by any act or omission of the Customer, its agents, subcontractors, or employees (a "Customer Default"), the Provider shall not be deemed in breach of the Agreement. In the event of a Customer Default: (a) the Provider shall be entitled to an extension of time equal to the duration of the delay; (b) the Provider shall be relieved from the obligation to perform the Services until the Customer remedies the default; and (c) the Customer shall reimburse the Provider for any additional costs, expenses, or losses incurred as a direct result of the Customer Default.

1.9 Independent Obligations. The obligations of the Customer set forth in this Section are independent of any other provision of this Agreement. The Customer’s failure to fulfill its obligations hereunder shall constitute a material breach, providing the Provider with the right to suspend Services or terminate the Agreement in accordance with the termination provisions herein.

## Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) Compliance

ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY (AUP) COMPLIANCE. The User represents, warrants, and covenants that it shall at all times access and utilize the Services in strict accordance with the Provider’s Acceptable Use Policy (“AUP”), as may be amended from time to time at the Provider’s sole and absolute discretion. The terms and conditions of the AUP are hereby incorporated into this Agreement by reference in their entirety. The User acknowledges and agrees that compliance with the AUP is a condition precedent to the Provider’s obligation to provide the Services, and any violation of the AUP shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement. 

Prohibited conduct under the AUP includes, without limitation: (i) the transmission, storage, or distribution of any information, data, or material that violates any applicable local, state, federal, or international law or regulation; (ii) any action that infringes upon, misappropriates, or otherwise violates the intellectual property rights, privacy rights, or other proprietary rights of any third party; (iii) the dissemination of defamatory, obscene, deceptive, or otherwise harmful content; (iv) any attempt to circumvent security measures, gain unauthorized access to any system, server, or network, or engage in any activity that interferes with the integrity, performance, or availability of the Services; and (v) the transmission of unsolicited bulk email (SPAM), malware, viruses, worms, Trojan horses, or other malicious or destructive code. 

The Provider reserves the right, but assumes no affirmative obligation, to monitor, review, or audit the User’s use of the Services to ensure strict adherence to the AUP. In the event the Provider determines, in its sole and absolute discretion, that the User has violated or attempted to violate any provision of the AUP, the Provider may, without prior notice and without liability or prejudice to any other rights or remedies available at law or in equity, immediately suspend or terminate the User’s access to the Services, remove or disable access to any offending content, and cooperate with legal authorities or third parties in the investigation of any suspected criminal or civil wrongdoing. 

The User shall be solely responsible for the acts and omissions of any third party accessing the Services through the User’s account or credentials, and such acts or omissions shall be deemed the acts or omissions of the User for purposes of AUP compliance. The User further agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Provider, its affiliates, officers, and employees from any and all claims, damages, liabilities, costs, or expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising out of or resulting from the User’s non-compliance with the AUP. The Provider’s failure to enforce any provision of the AUP in any specific instance shall not be construed as a waiver of its right to enforce such provision in the future or to enforce any other provision of the AUP.

4.2. Reimbursable Expenses. The Client shall reimburse the Provider for all reasonable, documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Provider’s personnel in connection with the performance of the Services, including but not limited to travel, lodging, and per diem expenses, provided that such expenses conform to the Client’s standard travel and expense policy or have been pre-approved in writing by the Client.

4.3. Invoicing Schedule. The Provider shall invoice the Client in accordance with the billing frequency specified in the SOW. If no such frequency is specified, the Provider shall issue invoices on a monthly basis in arrears for Services rendered during the preceding month.

4.4. Payment Deadlines and Method. All undisputed amounts set forth in an invoice are due and payable within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the invoice (the "Due Date"). Payment shall be made by wire transfer, Automated Clearing House (ACH) transfer, or such other electronic payment method as the Provider may designate from time to time.

4.5. Late Payment Charges. Any undisputed amount not paid by the Due Date shall bear interest at a rate equal to the lesser of: (i) one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month; or (ii) the maximum interest rate permitted by applicable law. Such interest shall accrue on a daily basis from the Due Date until the date of actual payment in full, whether before or after judgment. The Provider’s right to interest shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights or remedies available to the Provider at law or in equity.

4.6. Taxes and Duties. All Fees and other charges described in this Agreement are exclusive of any applicable federal, state, local, or foreign taxes, including but not limited to sales, use, value-added (VAT), excise, or withholding taxes (collectively, "Taxes"). The Client shall be responsible for the payment of all such Taxes, excluding taxes based solely on the Provider’s net income, corporate franchise, or property. If the Client is required by law to withhold any Taxes from payments due to the Provider, the Client shall provide the Provider with official tax receipts or other evidence of such payment to the appropriate taxing authorities.

4.7. Invoice Disputes. If the Client disputes any portion of an invoice in good faith, the Client must notify the Provider in writing of the specific nature of the dispute within fifteen (15) calendar days of the invoice date. Failure to provide such notice within the specified period shall constitute a waiver of the Client’s right to dispute the invoice. The Client shall timely pay all undisputed portions of any contested invoice. The parties shall thereafter work in good faith to resolve the disputed portion as expeditiously as possible.

4.8. Suspension of Performance. In the event that any undisputed payment remains outstanding for more than fifteen (15) calendar days beyond the Due Date, the Provider reserves the right, without prejudice to any other rights or remedies, to suspend the performance of the Services and the delivery of any Deliverables until all outstanding amounts, including accrued interest, are paid in full.

TAXES, DUTIES, AND WITHHOLDINGS.

(a) Tax Responsibilities.

(b) Net-of-Tax Payments and Gross-Up. All payments to be made by the Paying Party hereunder shall be made in full without any set-off, counterclaim, or deduction for or on account of any Taxes. In the event that the Paying Party is required by any applicable law, regulation, or treaty to withhold or deduct any amount for or on account of any Taxes from any payment due to the Receiving Party, the Paying Party shall: (i) timely remit the full amount of such withholding or deduction to the relevant governmental or taxing authority; (ii) provide the Receiving Party with official tax receipts or other evidence of payment reasonably satisfactory to the Receiving Party within thirty (30) days of such payment; and (iii) pay such additional amounts (the “Gross-Up”) as may be necessary to ensure that the Receiving Party receives and retains a net amount equal to the full amount it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.

(c) Tax Exemptions. If the Paying Party claims an exemption from any Taxes, it shall provide the Receiving Party with a valid, duly executed exemption certificate or other evidence of exemption acceptable to the relevant taxing authority. Until such time as a valid certificate is provided, the Receiving Party shall be entitled to charge, and the Paying Party shall be obligated to pay, all Taxes as required by law. The Paying Party shall promptly notify the Receiving Party of any change in its tax-exempt status.

(d) Indemnification. The Paying Party hereby agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Receiving Party, its affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, and employees from and against any and all liabilities, losses, costs, claims, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) arising out of or resulting from the Paying Party’s failure to pay any Taxes for which it is responsible or to comply with its obligations under this Section.

(e) Tax Cooperation. Each Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the other Party in minimizing any applicable Taxes and in providing any documentation or information reasonably required to comply with tax reporting obligations or to participate in any tax-related proceedings, including the provision of residency certificates or other documentation necessary to invoke the benefits of any applicable tax treaty.

## Fee Adjustments and Price Protections

4. FEE ADJUSTMENTS AND PRICE PROTECTIONS

4.1 Annual Rate Adjustments. Upon the expiration of the Initial Term and at the commencement of each successive Renewal Term thereafter, the Service Provider reserves the unilateral right to adjust the Fees set forth in the applicable Order Form or Statement of Work. Such adjustments shall be reflective of fluctuations in the Service Provider’s operational overhead, market conditions, and continued infrastructure investments. Any such annual increase shall be capped at a maximum of the greater of: (i) five percent (5%) of the Fees charged during the immediately preceding twelve-month period; or (ii) the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), U.S. City Average, as published by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics for the preceding twelve-month period.

4.2 Notice of Adjustment. The Service Provider shall provide the Client with formal written notice of any intended fee adjustment no less than sixty (60) calendar days prior to the effective date of the proposed increase. In the event the Client does not provide a written notice of non-renewal or a formal objection within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the adjustment notice, such inaction shall constitute the Client’s express and irrevocable acceptance of the adjusted Fees for the subsequent term.

4.3 Price Protection Period. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4.1, the Service Provider guarantees that the base Service Fees established as of the Effective Date shall remain fixed and shall not be subject to discretionary adjustment for the duration of the Initial Term (the "Price Protection Period"). This price protection is strictly limited to the specific volume, capacity, and scope of Services detailed in the original Statement of Work. Any supplementary services, expansions of seat licenses, or modifications to the Service levels requested by the Client during the Price Protection Period shall be billed at the Service Provider's then-prevailing market rates.

4.4 Scope Modifications and Out-of-Scope Services. If the Client requires services, functionalities, or deliverables not expressly delineated in the operative Statement of Work ("Out-of-Scope Services"), such services shall be subject to additional compensation. The Service Provider shall provide a comprehensive estimate for Out-of-Scope Services, and no work shall commence until a written amendment or supplemental work order is executed by authorized representatives of both Parties. Furthermore, the Service Provider reserves the right to adjust Fees proportionately and retroactively if the Client’s actual consumption of the Services exceeds the predefined usage tiers or capacity thresholds specified in the Agreement.

4.5 Regulatory and Third-Party Pass-Through Costs. The Service Provider reserves the right to pass through to the Client, and the Client hereby agrees to indemnify and pay, any new or increased costs imposed upon the Service Provider by third-party providers, sub-processors, or regulatory authorities that are directly attributable to the Services provided hereunder. This includes, but is not limited to, increases in data egress tariffs, cloud infrastructure surcharges, mandatory governmental levies, or costs associated with changes in applicable law. Such pass-through costs shall be exempt from the percentage caps established in Section 4.1 and the protections afforded in Section 4.3.

4.6 Right of Termination for Excessive Adjustment. In the event that a discretionary annual fee adjustment proposed by the Service Provider pursuant to Section 4.1 exceeds ten percent (10%) of the Fees paid by the Client in the immediately preceding twelve-month period, the Client shall have the limited right to terminate this Agreement by providing written notice of termination within twenty (20) calendar days of the Service Provider's notice of adjustment. If the Client exercises this termination right, the Agreement shall terminate on the date the proposed fee adjustment was to take effect, and the Client shall remain liable for all Fees accrued through the date of termination at the pre-adjustment rate. Failure to exercise this right within the specified timeframe shall be deemed a waiver of the Client’s right to contest the adjustment.

During the Term of this Agreement and for a period of five (5) years following the expiration or earlier termination hereof, each Party (the “Record-Keeping Party”) shall maintain complete, accurate, and organized books, records, accounts, and documentation (collectively, the “Records”) relating to its performance under this Agreement, including all data necessary to calculate, verify, and substantiate any payments, fees, royalties, or technical compliance obligations arising hereunder. All financial Records shall be maintained in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) or International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as applicable, consistently applied throughout the relevant periods.

[X].2 Reporting Requirements. The Record-Keeping Party shall provide the other Party (the “Requesting Party”) with detailed written reports on a calendar quarterly basis, delivered within thirty (30) days following the close of each such quarter. Such reports shall contain, at a minimum, an itemized breakdown of all transactions, usage metrics, and financial calculations relevant to the Requesting Party’s compensation or performance verification under this Agreement, and shall be certified as true and correct by an authorized financial officer of the Record-Keeping Party.

[X].3 Audit Rights. Upon no less than twenty (20) business days’ prior written notice, the Requesting Party, or a reputable, independent third-party accounting firm of its choosing that is not then engaged in a contingency-fee arrangement, shall have the right to inspect, examine, and audit the Records during the Record-Keeping Party’s normal business hours. Such audits shall be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the Record-Keeping Party’s ordinary business operations. The Requesting Party may exercise this audit right no more than once per calendar year, unless a prior audit has disclosed a material discrepancy or a breach of this Agreement remains uncured.

[X].4 Access and Cooperation. The Record-Keeping Party shall provide the auditor with reasonable access to its physical facilities, relevant personnel, and information technology systems as may be reasonably necessary to verify the accuracy of the Records. The Record-Keeping Party shall cooperate fully with the auditor’s inquiries and shall not withhold, redact, or otherwise obscure any information relevant to the scope of the audit, provided that the auditor shall be subject to the confidentiality obligations set forth herein.

[X].5 Audit Findings and Adjustments. If an audit reveals an underpayment or overpayment of any fees or charges, the Party responsible for the discrepancy shall remit the difference to the other Party within fifteen (15) days of the issuance of the final audit report. In the event of an underpayment, the Record-Keeping Party shall additionally pay interest on the underpaid amount at a rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month, or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is less, calculated from the date such payment was originally due until the date of payment.

[X].6 Allocation of Audit Costs. The Requesting Party shall bear the initial costs and expenses of any audit conducted under this Section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the audit discloses an underpayment by the Record-Keeping Party exceeding five percent (5%) of the total amount due for the period audited, or reveals a material breach of the Record-Keeping Party’s reporting obligations, the Record-Keeping Party shall immediately reimburse the Requesting Party for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and professional fees incurred in connection with such audit.

[X].7 Confidentiality of Audit Results. All information obtained, reviewed, or generated during the course of an audit shall be deemed Confidential Information and shall be subject to the non-disclosure obligations set forth in this Agreement. The Requesting Party shall ensure that any third-party auditor executes a confidentiality agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to the Record-Keeping Party prior to the commencement of any audit activities. The results of the audit shall be shared with both Parties simultaneously.

Vendor Intellectual Property includes, without limitation, all patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, source code, object code, proprietary interfaces, documentation, and any modifications, enhancements, or derivative works thereof, regardless of whether such modifications were developed during the performance of this Agreement.

(b) License Grant. To the extent that any Vendor Intellectual Property is incorporated into, embedded in, or required for the functional use of any Deliverables provided to Client under this Agreement, Vendor hereby grants to Client a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable (except as provided in the Assignment section of this Agreement), non-sublicensable, royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide license to use such Vendor Intellectual Property solely as an integrated component of the Deliverables and strictly for Client’s internal business purposes. This license shall persist only for the duration of Client's authorized use of the Deliverables and is subject to the terms and restrictions set forth herein.

## Aggregated Statistics and Anonymized Data Rights

AGGREGATED STATISTICS AND ANONYMIZED DATA RIGHTS

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any associated Privacy Policy, the Company shall have the right to collect, extract, compile, synthesize, and analyze non-personally identifiable data, information, and other content resulting from the User’s use of and access to the Services (collectively, “Aggregated Statistics”). The User acknowledges and agrees that all Aggregated Statistics are and shall remain the sole and exclusive property of the Company, and the Company shall have an irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, and sublicensable right to use, reproduce, modify, and distribute such Aggregated Statistics for any lawful business purpose. 

Such purposes include, but are not limited to, the benchmarking of performance metrics, the improvement and optimization of the Services, the development of new product or service offerings, the verification of security protocols, and the derivation of market insights or statistical trends.

The Company is under no obligation to review, consider, or implement any Feedback, and your submission of Feedback does not create any confidential, fiduciary, or contractual relationship between you and the Company beyond the terms expressly set forth herein. You further waive any and all claims against the Company relating to its use of similar or identical ideas or concepts that may be independently developed or derived from other sources.

## Confidentiality Obligations and Non-Disclosure

ARTICLE [X]: CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS AND NON-DISCLOSURE

1.1 Definition of Confidential Information. For purposes of this Agreement, "Confidential Information" shall mean any and all non-public, proprietary, or sensitive information, whether disclosed orally, in writing, or in any other medium, relating to the business, operations, finances, technology, intellectual property, trade secrets, know-how, customers, or strategic plans of the Disclosing Party. Confidential Information includes, without limitation, all data, reports, interpretations, forecasts, records, software, source code, object code, algorithms, business methods, marketing plans, and any other information that by its nature or the circumstances of its disclosure should reasonably be understood to be confidential, regardless of whether such information is marked as "Confidential," "Proprietary," or with a similar designation.

1.2 Obligations of the Receiving Party. The Receiving Party shall: (a) maintain the Confidential Information in strict confidence and apply no less than a reasonable degree of care, and in no event less than the degree of care it uses to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature, to prevent any unauthorized disclosure or use; (b) use the Confidential Information solely for the performance of its obligations or the exercise of its rights under this Agreement (the "Purpose") and for no other purpose whatsoever; (c) limit access to the Confidential Information to those of its employees, officers, directors, agents, or professional advisors (collectively, "Representatives") who have a legitimate "need to know" such information for the Purpose and who are bound by written confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those set forth herein; and (d) remain fully responsible and liable for any breach of this Article by any of its Representatives.

1.3 Exclusions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information shall not include information that the Receiving Party can demonstrate by written record: (a) was already in the public domain at the time of disclosure or subsequently becomes part of the public domain through no fault or breach of the Receiving Party; (b) was rightfully in the Receiving Party’s possession prior to disclosure by the Disclosing Party without an obligation of confidentiality; (c) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without the use of or reference to the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information; or (d) is received by the Receiving Party from a third party who has the lawful right to disclose such information without any restriction on disclosure.

1.4 Compelled Disclosure. In the event that the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives are required by law, regulation, or legal process (including, but not limited to, by subpoena, investigative demand, or order of a court or governmental agency) to disclose any Confidential Information, the Receiving Party shall, to the extent legally permissible, provide the Disclosing Party with prompt written notice of such requirement so that the Disclosing Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy. If such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, the Receiving Party shall disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information which it is legally required to disclose and shall exercise reasonable efforts to ensure that such disclosed information is treated as confidential.

1.5 Return or Destruction of Materials. Upon the written request of the Disclosing Party, or upon the expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason, the Receiving Party shall promptly return to the Disclosing Party or, at the Disclosing Party’s option, destroy all originals and copies of the Confidential Information in its possession or control, including all summaries, abstracts, or other documents derived therefrom. The Receiving Party shall, upon request, provide a written certification signed by an authorized officer confirming such return or destruction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party may retain one copy of the Confidential Information to the extent required by law or its internal data retention policies, provided that such retained information remains subject to the confidentiality obligations of this Agreement for as long as it is retained.

1.6 Ownership and No License. All Confidential Information remains the sole and exclusive property of the Disclosing Party. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as granting or conferring any rights, by license or otherwise, in or to any Confidential Information or any intellectual property rights of the Disclosing Party, except for the limited right to use the Confidential Information for the Purpose as expressly set forth herein.

1.7 Equitable Relief. The Receiving Party acknowledges and agrees that any breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this Article may cause irreparable harm to the Disclosing Party for which monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy. Accordingly, in the event of such breach or threatened breach, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief, specific performance, and any other equitable remedies from a court of competent jurisdiction, without the necessity of posting a bond or proving actual damages, in addition to any other rights or remedies available at law or in equity.

1.8 Survival of Obligations. The obligations of confidentiality and non-use set forth in this Article shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement for a period of [Number] years; provided, however, that with respect to any Confidential Information that constitutes a trade secret under applicable law, such obligations shall survive for as long as such information remains a trade secret.

## Exceptions to Confidential Information

EXCEPTIONS TO CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the obligations of confidentiality, non-disclosure, and non-use set forth herein shall not apply to any information, data, or materials that the Receiving Party can demonstrate by clear and convincing contemporaneous written documentation: (a) is or becomes generally available to and known by the public other than as a direct or indirect result of a disclosure by the Receiving Party or its Representatives in violation of the terms of this Agreement or any other duty of confidentiality; (b) was rightfully in the possession of, or demonstrably known by, the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis prior to the time of disclosure by or on behalf of the Disclosing Party, provided that the source of such information was not known by the Receiving Party, after diligent inquiry, to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with, or other contractual, legal, or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to, the Disclosing Party or any other third party with respect to such information; (c) is obtained by the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a third-party source, provided that such third party is not known by the Receiving Party, after diligent inquiry, to be prohibited from disclosing such information by a contractual, legal, or fiduciary obligation to the Disclosing Party; (d) was independently developed by or on behalf of the Receiving Party without the use of, reference to, or reliance upon, in whole or in part, the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information, as evidenced by the Receiving Party’s internal records; or (e) is expressly authorized for release or disclosure by the Disclosing Party through prior written consent. 

In the event that the Receiving Party or any of its Representatives are requested or required by applicable law, regulation, stock exchange rule, or a valid order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or a relevant governmental, regulatory, or administrative body (whether by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand, or similar process) to disclose any Confidential Information, the Receiving Party shall, to the extent legally permissible, provide the Disclosing Party with prompt written notice of such requirement so that the Disclosing Party may, at its sole cost and expense, seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. If, in the absence of a protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, the Receiving Party or its Representative is nonetheless legally compelled to disclose Confidential Information, the Receiving Party or such Representative may disclose only that portion of the Confidential Information that it is advised by written opinion of counsel is legally required to be disclosed; provided, however, that the Receiving Party shall exert its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment shall be accorded to the Confidential Information so disclosed and shall continue to treat such information as Confidential Information for all other purposes. No disclosure made pursuant to a legal requirement shall otherwise affect the Receiving Party's obligations with respect to the Confidential Information so disclosed or any other Confidential Information retained by the Receiving Party.

## Information Security Standards and Certifications

ARTICLE [X]: INFORMATION SECURITY STANDARDS AND CERTIFICATIONS

1.1 Maintenance of Comprehensive Security Program. The Provider represents, warrants, and covenants that it has implemented and shall maintain throughout the Term a comprehensive, written information security program (the "Security Program") comprising administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to: (a) ensure the security, integrity, and confidentiality of Protected Data; (b) protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of Protected Data; and (c) protect against unauthorized access to or use of Protected Data that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to the Customer or any Data Subject. Such Security Program shall, at a minimum, adhere to prevailing industry best practices and the specific standards set forth in this Article.

1.2 Mandatory Certifications and Standards. The Provider shall maintain, at its sole cost and expense, current and valid certifications and compliance attestations for the following frameworks: (i) ISO/IEC 27001 (Information Security Management Systems); (ii) SOC 2 Type II (System and Organization Controls) covering the Trust Services Criteria of Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, and Confidentiality; and (iii) where applicable to the nature of the data processed, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Security Rule. The Provider shall ensure that such certifications are renewed annually or at the intervals required by the respective standards body by a qualified, independent third-party auditing firm of recognized professional standing.

1.3 Audit Reports and Evidence of Compliance. Upon the written request of the Customer, but no more than once per calendar year—unless following the occurrence of a Security Breach or as required by a regulatory authority—the Provider shall provide copies of its most recent audit reports (e.g., SOC 2 Type II report, ISO 27001 certificate of registration, or equivalent summary reports). All such reports and documentation shall be deemed the Confidential Information of the Provider. If the Provider's audit cycle results in a "gap period" between the expiration of a prior report and the issuance of a successor report, the Provider shall, upon request, provide a "bridge letter" or "letter of comfort" signed by an officer of the Provider attesting that there have been no material changes to the control environment since the conclusion of the prior audit period.

1.4 Notification of Material Change or Non-Compliance. The Provider shall notify the Customer in writing within forty-eight (48) hours if: (a) it fails to maintain or renew any certification required under Section 1.2; (b) an audit report identifies a material weakness, significant deficiency, or qualified opinion regarding the effectiveness of its Security Program; or (c) it undergoes a material change in its security infrastructure that materially diminishes the protections afforded to Protected Data. In the event of such non-compliance, the Provider shall immediately initiate remediation efforts and provide the Customer with a detailed corrective action plan and a firm timeline for resolution.

1.5 Technical Security Requirements. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Provider’s Security Program shall incorporate the following technical controls: (i) encryption of data at rest and in transit using industry-standard cryptographic protocols (e.g., AES-256 and TLS 1.2 or higher); (ii) mandatory multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all administrative, remote, and privileged access to the Provider's systems; (iii) formal vulnerability management and penetration testing programs conducted at least annually by an independent third party; (iv) logical and/or physical isolation of Customer Data from the data of other tenants; and (v) comprehensive, immutable logging and monitoring of all system access and administrative actions.

1.6 Subprocessor Compliance and Flow-Down. The Provider shall ensure that any third-party subcontractors, subprocessors, or service providers who are granted access to Protected Data are contractually bound by security obligations no less stringent than those set forth in this Article. The Provider shall conduct regular due diligence on such third parties to verify their adherence to these standards and shall be liable for any acts or omissions of its subprocessors that result in a breach of these Information Security Standards.

1.7 Customer Right to Audit. Notwithstanding the provision of third-party audit reports under Section 1.3, if the Customer has a reasonable basis to believe the Provider is in material breach of its security obligations, or if required by a regulatory authority with jurisdiction over the Customer, the Customer (or its designated independent auditor) shall have the right, upon no less than thirty (30) days' prior written notice and during normal business hours, to conduct an on-site audit of the Provider’s security practices, facilities, and systems relevant to the performance of this Agreement. Any such audit shall be conducted in a manner that minimizes disruption to the Provider's operations and shall be subject to the Provider’s reasonable security and confidentiality protocols.

1.8 Remedy for Breach of Standards. The Provider’s failure to maintain the certifications required under Section 1.2, or a failure to remediate a material deficiency identified in an audit within thirty (30) days of the date such deficiency is identified, shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement. In such event, the Customer may, at its sole discretion, terminate the Agreement for cause without penalty, or require the Provider to escrow a portion of the Service Fees until such time as compliance is verified by an independent third party.

Immediately following the discovery of a Security Breach, the Processor shall, at its sole cost and expense: (a) conduct a comprehensive forensic investigation to determine the root cause, scope, and impact of the breach; (b) take all necessary and immediate steps to contain the breach, prevent further unauthorized access, and restore the integrity of the affected systems; (c) preserve all relevant forensic evidence, including logs, system images, and traffic data; and (d) implement a detailed remediation plan, subject to the Controller’s approval, to address the vulnerabilities that permitted the Security Breach and to prevent a recurrence of similar incidents.

12.5. Cooperation and Regulatory Compliance. The Processor shall provide all necessary cooperation and assistance to the Controller to enable the Controller to comply with its legal and regulatory obligations, including any mandatory notifications to supervisory authorities, law enforcement, or affected data subjects under applicable Data Protection Laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA). The Processor shall not make any public statement, press release, or notification to third parties regarding the Security Breach without the prior written consent of the Controller, unless such disclosure is strictly required by applicable law, in which case the Processor shall provide the Controller with the maximum possible advance notice and an opportunity to review and comment on the proposed disclosure.

12.6. Reporting and Records. The Processor shall maintain a comprehensive log of all Security Breaches and suspected security incidents, including documentation of the facts relating to the breach, its effects, and the remedial actions taken.

## Data Residency, Sovereignty, and Cross-Border Transfers

DATA RESIDENCY, SOVEREIGNTY, AND CROSS-BORDER TRANSFERS

1.1 Primary Data Residency. The Company shall maintain the storage and processing of Customer Personal Data within the geographical jurisdiction(s) expressly specified in the Service Agreement or applicable Order Form (the "Designated Region"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Customer acknowledges that metadata, service logs, and telemetry data generated through the use of the Services may be processed in global data centers to ensure service availability, performance optimization, and security monitoring, subject to the protective measures set forth herein.

1.2 Data Sovereignty and Jurisdictional Compliance. All Personal Data processed under this Agreement shall remain subject to the data sovereignty laws of the jurisdiction of origin where mandated by applicable law. The Company warrants that it shall not move the primary residency of the Customer’s production data to a jurisdiction outside of the Designated Region without providing prior written notice to the Customer, except where such relocation is required to comply with a mandatory legal obligation or to prevent a catastrophic failure of the Services. In the event of such a relocation, the Company shall ensure that the destination jurisdiction provides a level of protection essentially equivalent to that of the Designated Region.

1.3 Authorization for Cross-Border Transfers. To the extent that the provision of Services requires the transfer of Personal Data across national borders—including transfers to the Company’s affiliates, subsidiaries, or third-party Sub-processors located outside the Designated Region—the Customer hereby grants a general authorization for such transfers, provided that the Company strictly adheres to the transfer mechanisms codified under applicable Data Protection Laws, including but not limited to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the UK Data Protection Act 2018, and the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection.

1.4 International Transfer Mechanisms. For any transfer of Personal Data from the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom, or Switzerland to a "third country" not recognized by the European Commission or relevant supervisory authority as providing an adequate level of protection, the Parties hereby incorporate by reference the Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) as approved by the European Commission (Implementing Decision (EU) 2021/914) or the International Data Transfer Addendum (IDTA) as issued by the UK Information Commissioner’s Office, as applicable. The execution of this Agreement shall be deemed execution of the applicable SCCs and Appendices in their entirety. Where the Company relies on Binding Corporate Rules (BCR) or other recognized certification mechanisms, it shall provide documentation of such adequacy upon written request by the Customer.

1.5 Transfer Impact Assessments (TIA). The Company shall, upon request, provide the Customer with reasonable assistance and information necessary to conduct a Transfer Impact Assessment. This includes detailed descriptions of the legal regime of the recipient country, the technical and organizational measures implemented to protect the data during transit and at rest, and the Company’s internal policies regarding the handling of government access requests.

1.6 Government and Law Enforcement Access Requests. The Company shall notify the Customer of any legally binding request for disclosure of Personal Data by a law enforcement or government authority in a recipient jurisdiction, unless such notification is prohibited by law (such as a prohibition under criminal law to preserve the confidentiality of a law enforcement investigation). In the event the Company is prohibited from notifying the Customer, the Company shall use all commercially reasonable legal efforts to obtain a waiver of the prohibition and shall challenge any overbroad or unlawful request for data access in accordance with the Company’s Government Request Policy.

1.7 Sub-processor Compliance. The Company shall ensure that any Sub-processor involved in cross-border processing operations is bound by written contractual obligations that are no less protective than those set forth in this Section. The Company remains fully liable to the Customer for the performance of the Sub-processor’s data protection obligations, specifically regarding the maintenance of data residency requirements and the legality of subsequent onward transfers.

1.8 Technical Safeguards for Transfers. To mitigate risks associated with cross-border transfers and sovereignty concerns, the Company shall employ robust technical safeguards, including but not limited to end-to-end encryption in transit (using TLS 1.2 or higher) and encryption at rest (using AES-256 or equivalent), with cryptographic keys managed in a manner that prevents unauthorized access by the host jurisdiction’s authorities to the extent permitted by technological capabilities and local law.

## Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Planning

DISASTER RECOVERY AND BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLANNING

1.1 Maintenance of Plans. The Service Provider represents, warrants, and covenants that it has developed and implemented, and shall maintain throughout the Term of this Agreement, comprehensive written business continuity and disaster recovery plans (collectively, the "BCDR Plans"). The BCDR Plans shall be designed to ensure the continued performance of the Service Provider’s obligations under this Agreement and to minimize any disruption to the Services in the event of a Disaster. For purposes of this Section, a "Disaster" shall mean any unanticipated incident or event, including but not limited to acts of God, fire, flood, earthquake, war, terrorism, civil unrest, labor strikes, pandemics, systemic telecommunications failures, utility outages, or significant cyber-security breaches, that results in a material degradation of the Services or prevents the Service Provider from operating its primary facilities or infrastructure in accordance with the performance standards set forth herein.

1.2 Minimum Requirements and Standards. The BCDR Plans shall, at a minimum: (a) adhere to prevailing industry-standard frameworks, including but not limited to ISO/IEC 27031 and ISO 22301; (b) provide for redundant infrastructure, failover mechanisms, and geographically diverse data centers to mitigate single points of failure; (c) establish specific Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) that align with the critical nature of the Services; (d) detail specific procedures for the secure backup, replication, and restoration of all Client Data; and (e) define an organizational command structure with designated emergency response personnel available on a 24/7/365 basis.

1.3 Data Redundancy and Off-site Storage. Service Provider shall perform incremental backups of all Client Data at least once every twenty-four (24) hours and full backups on a weekly basis, or more frequently as necessitated by the specific Service Level Agreement (SLA). All backup media and replicated data shall be encrypted at rest using AES-256 or higher encryption standards and shall be stored in a secure, off-site location or immutable cloud-based environment that is geographically distinct from the primary production environment by a distance sufficient to ensure it is not impacted by the same regional Disaster.

1.4 Testing and Validation. No less than once every twelve (12) calendar months, the Service Provider shall conduct comprehensive functional testing and table-top drills of its BCDR Plans to validate the effectiveness of its recovery strategies and the integrity of its backup systems. Within thirty (30) days of the completion of such testing, the Service Provider shall, upon written request, provide the Client with a formal executive summary or certification evidencing the successful completion of the tests, identifying any deficiencies discovered, and outlining the remediation steps taken or planned to address such deficiencies.

1.5 Notification and Activation. In the event of an actual Disaster or a credible threat of a Disaster, the Service Provider shall notify the Client’s primary technical contact as soon as commercially practicable, but in no event later than two (2) hours following the Service Provider’s determination that a Disaster has occurred or that the BCDR Plans have been activated. Such notification shall include a summary of the event, the anticipated impact on Service availability, and the estimated timeframe for restoration of normal operations. During the pendency of a Disaster, the Service Provider shall provide the Client with status updates at intervals no less frequent than every four (4) hours until the Services are fully restored.

1.6 Audit Rights. The Client, or a designated independent third-party auditor subject to appropriate confidentiality obligations, shall have the right, upon reasonable prior notice, to inspect and audit the Service Provider’s BCDR Plans, test results, and facilities to verify compliance with the requirements of this Section. Service Provider shall cooperate fully with any such audit and shall provide access to relevant documentation and personnel as reasonably required.

1.7 No Relief of Performance Obligations. Notwithstanding any "Force Majeure" provision contained in this Agreement, the occurrence of a Disaster shall not excuse the Service Provider from its obligation to implement the BCDR Plans and to restore the Services within the RTO and RPO parameters specified herein. The failure of the Service Provider to maintain the BCDR Plans or to restore the Services in accordance with the BCDR Plans shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement, entitling the Client to exercise all available remedies, including but not limited to the assessment of service credits or termination of the Agreement for cause.

## Intellectual Property Indemnification by Vendor

Intellectual Property Indemnification. Vendor shall, at its sole cost and expense, indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Customer, its parent company, affiliates, and subsidiaries, and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, successors, and permitted assigns (collectively, "Indemnified Parties"), from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, actions, judgments, settlements, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs, or expenses of whatever kind, including reasonable attorneys' fees, disbursements, and the cost of enforcing any right to indemnification hereunder and the cost of pursuing any insurance providers (collectively, "Losses"), arising out of or resulting from any third-party claim, suit, action, or proceeding (each, a "Claim") alleging that the Services, Deliverables, software, hardware, or any other materials provided by Vendor to Customer under this Agreement (collectively, the "Vendor Materials") infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate any third-party intellectual property right, including but not limited to any patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, or other proprietary right.

Vendor’s obligations under this Section are conditioned upon: (a) the Indemnified Party providing prompt written notice to Vendor of any Claim for which indemnification is sought, provided that any delay in notification shall not relieve Vendor of its obligations except to the extent that Vendor is materially prejudiced by such delay; (b) Vendor having sole control over the defense and settlement of the Claim, provided that Vendor may not enter into any settlement that admits liability on the part of an Indemnified Party or imposes any affirmative obligation or financial liability on an Indemnified Party without the Indemnified Party’s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed; and (c) the Indemnified Party providing reasonable cooperation and assistance to Vendor, at Vendor’s expense, in the defense and settlement of the Claim.

If any of the Vendor Materials are held, or in Vendor's reasonable opinion are likely to be held, to infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate any third-party intellectual property right, Vendor shall, at its option and expense: (i) procure for Customer the right to continue using the Vendor Materials as contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) replace or modify the Vendor Materials so that they become non-infringing while providing substantially equivalent functionality, performance, and compatibility; or (iii) if the foregoing options are not commercially feasible despite Vendor's best efforts, terminate this Agreement (or the applicable Order Form) and refund to Customer all prepaid but unearned fees, along with the unamortized portion of any one-time fees paid for the infringing Vendor Materials, calculated on a straight-line basis over a thirty-six (36) month period.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Vendor shall have no obligation to indemnify or defend any Indemnified Party against any Claim to the extent such Claim arises directly from: (x) the Indemnified Party’s use of the Vendor Materials in combination with any hardware, software, data, or other materials not provided or authorized by Vendor in writing, if the Claim would have been avoided but for such combination; (y) modifications to the Vendor Materials made by any party other than Vendor or its authorized agents without Vendor's express written approval; or (z) Vendor's strict compliance with specific designs, specifications, or instructions provided by Customer, provided that such infringement was not inherent in Vendor's own implementation of such specifications. THIS SECTION SETS FORTH THE VENDOR’S ENTIRE LIABILITY AND THE CUSTOMER’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY ACTUAL OR ALLEGED INFRINGEMENT OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

## General Indemnification by Customer

Customer shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Company and its parent, subsidiaries, and affiliates, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, successors, and permitted assigns (collectively, the "Company Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, actions, judgments, settlements, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs, or expenses of whatever kind, including reasonable attorneys' fees and the costs of enforcing any right to indemnification under this Agreement and the cost of pursuing any insurance providers (collectively, "Losses"), incurred by a Company Indemnified Party, arising out of or resulting from any third-party claim, suit, action, or proceeding ("Third-Party Claim") related to: (i) Customer's breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, or obligation under this Agreement; (ii) any negligent or more culpable act or omission by Customer or its personnel (including any reckless or willful misconduct) in connection with the performance of its obligations under this Agreement; (iii) any violation of applicable law, rule, or regulation by Customer; (iv) the use of the services or products provided hereunder in a manner not expressly authorized by this Agreement; or (v) any allegation that Customer Data or other materials provided by Customer infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate the intellectual property, proprietary, or privacy rights of any third party. Customer may not settle any Third-Party Claim against a Company Indemnified Party without the Company Indemnified Party’s prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed, unless the settlement includes a full and unconditional release of the Company Indemnified Party from all liability and does not impose any financial or performance obligation on the Company Indemnified Party. The Company Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its own expense, to participate in the defense of any Third-Party Claim with counsel of its own choosing. Customer’s obligations under this Section shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.

## Indemnification Procedures and Control of Defense

INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURES AND CONTROL OF DEFENSE

(a) Notice of Claim. If any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder (the "Indemnified Party") receives notice of the assertion or commencement of any investigation, claim, action, suit, or proceeding (a "Claim") by a third party (a "Third-Party Claim") for which the other party (the "Indemnifying Party") is obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof (a "Claim Notice"). The Claim Notice shall describe the Third-Party Claim in reasonable detail and shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The failure to afford such prompt Claim Notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced by such failure.

(b) Assumption and Control of Defense. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, exercisable by written notice to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Claim Notice, to assume the direction and control of the defense of such Third-Party Claim at the Indemnifying Party’s sole cost and expense and through counsel of its own choosing, provided that such counsel is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ, at its own expense, separate counsel of its own design; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the Indemnified Party has been advised by counsel that a reasonable likelihood exists of a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party in the conduct of the defense of such Third-Party Claim; (ii) the Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense or employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; or (iii) the Indemnified Party has legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnifying Party.

(c) Limitations on Indemnifying Party’s Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume or maintain control of the defense of any Third-Party Claim and shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified Party if (i) the Third-Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, or investigation; (ii) the Third-Party Claim seeks an injunction or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party; (iii) the Indemnifying Party has failed or is failing to prosecute or defend such Third-Party Claim in good faith and with reasonable diligence; or (iv) the amount of the potential Loss, as reasonably determined by the Indemnified Party, exceeds the maximum amount for which the Indemnifying Party is liable under the limitations of liability set forth in this Agreement.

(d) Settlement of Claims. The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed), settle, compromise, or offer to settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party may settle a Third-Party Claim without the Indemnified Party’s consent if such settlement (i) includes as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the person or persons asserting such Third-Party Claim to the Indemnified Party of a complete and unconditional release from all liability with respect to such Third-Party Claim; (ii) involves only the payment of monetary damages by the Indemnifying Party; and (iii) does not include any admission of fault, culpability, or failure to act by or on behalf of the Indemnified Party or any requirement that the Indemnified Party admit to any infraction of law. Conversely, the Indemnified Party shall not settle or compromise any Third-Party Claim for which it is seeking indemnification without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed.

(e) Cooperation. The Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith in the defense or prosecution of any Third-Party Claim and shall furnish such records, information, and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials, and appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith. Such cooperation shall include access during normal business hours afforded to the Indemnifying Party to and copies of all relevant business records and other documents and the use of personnel of the Indemnified Party as witnesses and consultants, provided that such access does not unreasonably interfere with the Indemnified Party’s business operations or waive any attorney-client privilege.

(f) Direct Claims. In the event an Indemnified Party has a claim against an Indemnifying Party that does not involve a Third-Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected from such Indemnified Party (a "Direct Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall deliver a Claim Notice with reasonable promptness to the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of the Claim Notice to respond in writing to such Direct Claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which case the Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to the Indemnified Party under this Agreement or applicable law.

## Limitation of Liability: Liability Caps

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY; LIABILITY CAPS.

(a) Aggregate Monetary Cap. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the total, cumulative, and aggregate liability of either Party, including its respective affiliates, subsidiaries, officers, directors, employees, agents, subcontractors, and permitted successors and assigns (collectively, the "Related Parties"), for any and all claims, demands, suits, losses, costs, expenses, liabilities, or damages of any kind or nature whatsoever (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of investigation), whether arising in contract, tort (including negligence, whether active, passive, or imputed), strict liability, breach of statutory duty, indemnity, contribution, or any other legal or equitable theory, arising out of or in any way connected with the execution, performance, or non-performance of this Agreement, or the use or provision of any services or deliverables contemplated herein, shall be strictly limited to and shall not exceed, in the aggregate, the total amount of fees actually paid by Customer to Provider under this Agreement during the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the date upon which the event, or the first in a series of related events, giving rise to such liability first occurred.

(b) Multiple Claims. The limitation of liability set forth in Section (a) is a single, cumulative aggregate limit and is not per-incident or per-claim. The existence of one or more claims, causes of action, or suits under this Agreement shall not operate to increase, enlarge, or extend the aggregate monetary limit specified herein. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the fees and pricing for the services and/or products provided hereunder reflect the specific allocation of risk set forth in this Section, and that neither Party would have entered into this Agreement without the inclusion of these limitations and exclusions.

(c) Specific Exclusions from the Cap. The limitations of liability set forth in Section (a) shall not apply to: (i) a Party’s liability for death or personal injury resulting from its gross negligence or willful misconduct; (ii) a Party’s liability for fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, or criminal acts; (iii) Customer’s obligation to pay all undisputed fees, expenses, and taxes properly invoiced and due under this Agreement; or (iv) any other liability which, under the governing law of this Agreement, may not be limited or excluded as a matter of public policy. Except as expressly provided in this Section (c) or elsewhere in this Agreement, the aggregate liability cap set forth in Section (a) shall apply to all indemnification obligations of either Party and all other liabilities arising from any breach of confidentiality, data protection, or intellectual property provisions.

(d) Essential Purpose. The Parties expressly agree that the limitations and exclusions of liability set forth in this Section will survive and apply even if any limited remedy specified in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose. Each Party hereby waives any right to assert that these limitations are unconscionable, commercially unreasonable, or otherwise unenforceable. Any action arising out of or related to this Agreement must be brought within one (1) year after the cause of action accrues, or such action shall be deemed permanently barred and waived.

## Exclusions from Limitation of Liability (Super Caps)

EXCLUSIONS FROM LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND SUPER CAPS. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the limitations of liability set forth in Section [X] (General Limitation of Liability) shall not apply to, and shall not serve to limit, the liability of either party for: (a) death or personal injury caused by the negligence of a party, its employees, agents, or representatives; (b) fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, or willful misconduct; (c) the party’s indemnification obligations under Section [Y] (Indemnification), including but not limited to claims arising from intellectual property infringement or misappropriation; (d) any breach of Section [Z] (Confidentiality), excluding those breaches specifically related to the unauthorized processing or disclosure of Personal Data which may be subject to a Super Cap; (e) a party’s gross negligence; (f) the payment of fees, interest, or expenses due and payable under the terms of this Agreement; or (g) any other liability that cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law. Furthermore, in the event of a breach of a party’s obligations regarding data privacy, security, or the Data Processing Addendum (a “Data Breach Claim”), the liability of the defaulting party shall be subject to an enhanced limitation of liability (a “Super Cap”) equal to [Insert Multiple, e.g., three (3) times] the General Limitation of Liability set forth in Section [X]. The application of this Super Cap shall be independent of, and in addition to, the General Limitation of Liability, such that any amounts paid, awarded, or credited toward the General Limitation of Liability shall not reduce the amount available under the Super Cap, and any amounts paid under the Super Cap shall not reduce the amount available under the General Limitation of Liability. In no event shall a party be entitled to duplicative recovery for the same underlying loss. To the extent that any specific liability, claim, or damage falls within the scope of more than one exclusion or cap described in this Section, the provision providing for the highest limit of liability—or, if applicable, unlimited liability—shall take precedence and govern such claim.

## Insurance Coverage and Policy Requirements

INSURANCE COVERAGE AND POLICY REQUIREMENTS

1.1 Maintenance of Coverage. The Contractor shall, at its sole cost and expense, procure and maintain in full force and effect throughout the term of this Agreement, and for such period thereafter as may be required herein, the minimum insurance coverages set forth below. All such insurance shall be primary and non-contributory to any insurance or self-insurance maintained by the Client. The requirements stipulated herein shall not be construed as a limitation of the Contractor’s liability under this Agreement or as a representation that the coverage is sufficient to protect the Contractor from the risks inherent in its performance of the Services.

1.2 Minimum Scope and Limits of Insurance. 

(a) Commercial General Liability (CGL): Written on an "occurrence" basis, including coverage for bodily injury, property damage, personal and advertising injury, products-completed operations, and contractual liability, with limits of no less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence and Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) in the general aggregate.

(b) Professional Liability (Errors and Omissions): Covering acts, errors, or omissions arising out of the performance of professional services under this Agreement, with limits of no less than Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) per claim and in the aggregate. If such policy is written on a "claims-made" basis, the Contractor warrants that any retroactive date under the policy shall precede the effective date of this Agreement and that continuous coverage will be maintained, or an extended discovery period (tail coverage) will be exercised, for a period of three (3) years beginning from the time services under this Agreement are completed.

(c) Workers’ Compensation and Employer’s Liability: Workers’ Compensation insurance as required by the laws of the state(s) in which the services are to be performed, and Employer’s Liability insurance with limits of not less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) for each accident, One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) for each employee by disease, and One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) policy limit for disease.

(d) Business Automobile Liability: Covering all owned, non-owned, and hired vehicles used in connection with the performance of this Agreement, with a combined single limit of no less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) per accident for bodily injury and property damage.

1.3 Carrier Requirements. All insurance policies required under this Section shall be issued by insurance companies with a current A.M. Best’s rating of no less than A- (Financial Size Category VIII) and which are duly licensed or authorized to conduct business in the jurisdictions where the services are performed.

1.4 Additional Insured Status. The Commercial General Liability and Business Automobile Liability policies shall be endorsed to name the Client, its officers, directors, employees, and agents as "Additional Insureds" for liability arising out of the Contractor’s performance. Such coverage shall be provided via ISO endorsements CG 20 10 and CG 20 37, or their functional equivalents, and shall remain in effect for the duration of the statute of repose in the applicable jurisdiction.

1.5 Waiver of Subrogation. The Contractor hereby grants to the Client a waiver of any right to subrogation which any insurer of said Contractor may acquire against the Client by virtue of the payment of any loss under such insurance. The Contractor agrees to obtain any endorsement that may be necessary to affect this waiver of subrogation, but this provision applies regardless of whether or not the Client has received a waiver of subrogation endorsement from the insurer.

1.6 Certificates of Insurance and Notice. Prior to the commencement of work, the Contractor shall furnish the Client with original certificates of insurance (COI) and amendatory endorsements evidencing the coverages required herein. The Contractor shall provide the Client with at least thirty (30) days' prior written notice in the event of any cancellation, non-renewal, or material reduction in coverage. The Contractor’s failure to provide or maintain the required insurance shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement, entitling the Client to terminate the Agreement immediately or, at its option, to purchase such insurance at the Contractor’s expense.

1.7 Deductibles and Self-Insured Retentions. Any deductibles or self-insured retentions (SIRs) must be declared to and approved by the Client. The Contractor shall be solely responsible for the payment of all deductibles and SIRs. At the option of the Client, the Contractor shall either reduce or eliminate such deductibles or SIRs as respects the Client, or provide a financial guarantee satisfactory to the Client guaranteeing payment of losses and related investigations, claim administration, and defense expenses.

1.8 Separation of Insureds. All liability policies shall contain a cross-liability or "severability of interest" clause, providing that the insurance applies separately to each insured against whom claim is made or suit is brought, except with respect to the limits of the insurer’s liability.

## Initial Term and Renewal Mechanisms

Section [X]. Initial Term and Renewal Mechanisms.

[X].1 Initial Term. The contractual relationship governed by this Agreement shall formally commence on the Effective Date and, subject to the early termination provisions stipulated in Section [Y] herein, shall persist in full force and effect for a fixed duration of [Number] ([#]) consecutive months (the "Initial Term"). Neither Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement for convenience during the Initial Term except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement.

[X].2 Automatic Successive Renewals. Upon the expiration of the Initial Term, this Agreement shall be automatically and perpetually renewed for successive subsequent periods of [Number] ([#]) months each (each a "Renewal Term," and collectively with the Initial Term, the "Term"), unless and until either Party provides the other Party with formal written notice of its unequivocal intent to opt out of such renewal (a "Notice of Non-Renewal"). To be effective, a Notice of Non-Renewal must be delivered to the non-terminating Party no later than [Number] ([#]) calendar days prior to the expiration of the then-current Initial Term or Renewal Term (the "Notice Period"). 

[X].3 Conditions Precedent to Renewal. The automatic renewal of this Agreement is strictly contingent upon the following conditions being satisfied as of the commencement date of any Renewal Term: (a) the Party seeking renewal (or benefiting from the automatic renewal) must not be in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, or obligation set forth in this Agreement; (b) no Event of Default, nor any event which with the passage of time or the giving of notice would constitute an Event of Default, shall have occurred and remain uncured; and (c) all outstanding consideration, fees, and liquidated sums due and owing under the Agreement must have been paid in full.

[X].4 Rate Adjustments and Modifications. The Service Provider reserves the right to adjust the fee schedules, consideration structures, or service rates applicable to any Renewal Term. Such adjustments shall be communicated to the Client in writing at least [Number] ([#]) days prior to the expiration of the then-current Term. In the event the Client does not provide a Notice of Non-Renewal within the timeframe specified in Section [X].2 following receipt of such rate adjustment notice, the Client shall be deemed to have irrevocably accepted the revised rates for the duration of the subsequent Renewal Term. Any such escalation in fees shall be limited to the greater of [Percentage]% per annum or the annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI-U) for the preceding twelve-month period, unless otherwise negotiated in a signed addendum.

[X].5 Effect of Termination and Survival. Upon the effective date of expiration resulting from a timely Notice of Non-Renewal, all executory obligations of the Parties shall cease, save for those provisions which by their nature are intended to survive termination, including but not limited to indemnification, limitation of liability, confidentiality, and governing law. The expiration of the Term shall not relieve either Party of any liability for breaches occurring prior to the date of termination or for any payment obligations that accrued during the Initial Term or any Renewal Term.

## Termination for Cause

TERMINATION FOR CAUSE. The Company may, at its sole discretion and effective immediately upon delivery of written notice to the Consultant (the "Termination Notice"), terminate this Agreement and the Consultant’s engagement hereunder for Cause. For the purposes of this Agreement, "Cause" shall mean the occurrence of any of the following: (a) the Consultant’s material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, or obligation set forth in this Agreement, or any other written agreement between the Consultant and the Company; (b) the Consultant’s failure or refusal to perform the Services or to comply with the lawful and reasonable directives of the Company’s Board of Directors or authorized officers; (c) any act of fraud, embezzlement, misappropriation of funds, theft, or other act of dishonesty by the Consultant; (d) the Consultant’s conviction of, or plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, a felony or any crime involving moral turpitude, dishonesty, or breach of trust; (e) any gross negligence, willful misconduct, or bad faith by the Consultant in the performance of their duties which results in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, material harm to the Company’s business, reputation, or financial condition; (f) the Consultant’s material violation of the Company’s internal policies, including but not limited to policies governing harassment, discrimination, ethics, or data security; (g) the unauthorized disclosure of the Company’s Confidential Information or Trade Secrets; or (h) any conduct by the Consultant that constitutes a conflict of interest that is not disclosed to and waived by the Company in writing. In the event the Company determines, in its reasonable judgment, that the underlying circumstances constituting Cause are capable of being cured, the Company shall provide the Consultant with written notice of such circumstances and a period of ten (10) business days to effectuate a cure to the Company's satisfaction; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to provide a cure period for any breach that is not, by its nature, curable or for any subsequent breach of a similar nature. Upon a termination for Cause, the Company’s sole and exclusive obligation to the Consultant shall be the payment of any undisputed fees for Services actually rendered and approved expenses actually incurred prior to the effective date of termination. The Consultant shall not be entitled to any further compensation, severance, or benefits, and any unvested equity or performance-based incentives shall be immediately and irrevocably forfeited.

The rights and remedies of the Parties provided in this Section are not exclusive and are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, in equity, or under this Agreement. Any termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section shall be without prejudice to any accrued rights or liabilities of either Party as of the date of termination.

Upon the delivery of a notice of termination or prior to the natural expiration of this Agreement, for any reason whatsoever (including a material breach by either Party), the Service Provider shall, for a period of up to one hundred eighty (180) days following the effective date of such termination or expiration (the "Transition Period"), provide all such cooperation and assistance as may be reasonably requested by the Client to facilitate the orderly, non-disruptive, and seamless migration of the Services to the Client or to a designated third-party successor service provider (the "Successor Provider"). The objective of such Transition Assistance is to minimize any interruption to the Client’s business operations and to ensure that the quality and continuity of the Services are maintained at levels consistent with the performance standards set forth in this Agreement until the final cutover is completed.

2. Scope of Disengagement Services. The Transition Assistance and Disengagement Services shall include, but are not limited to: (a) the continued performance of all or a subset of the Services as requested by the Client; (b) the provision of a comprehensive Disengagement Plan outlining the critical path, milestones, and resource requirements for the migration; (c) the delivery and return of all Client Data in a format reasonably requested by the Client that is readily usable and compatible with the Successor Provider’s systems; (d) the provision of technical specifications, interface requirements, and operational documentation necessary for the Successor Provider to assume the performance of the Services; (e) the performance of knowledge transfer sessions, training, and consultation for the Client’s or Successor Provider’s personnel; and (f) the granting of limited access to the Service Provider’s facilities and systems to the extent necessary for the migration of data and configurations.

3. Cooperation with Successor Providers. During the Transition Period, the Service Provider shall cooperate in good faith with the Client and any Successor Provider. Such cooperation shall include, without limitation, the timely response to reasonable inquiries, participation in transition planning meetings, and the coordination of data migration activities. The Service Provider shall not willfully or through gross negligence impede or delay the transition process. The Service Provider acknowledges that its duty to cooperate shall exist notwithstanding any dispute between the Parties, provided that the Client continues to pay all undisputed Transition Fees as defined herein.

4. Data Integrity and Security. Throughout the Transition Period, the Service Provider shall maintain the security and integrity of all Client Data and shall continue to apply the data protection standards and encryption protocols required under this Agreement. Upon the conclusion of the Transition Period and the Client’s written confirmation of successful data migration, the Service Provider shall, at the Client’s option, either return or securely destroy all remaining copies of Client Data in its possession, providing a formal certificate of destruction to the Client within ten (10) business days thereof.

5. Fees for Transition Assistance. Unless the Agreement is terminated by the Client for the Service Provider's uncured material breach, the Client shall compensate the Service Provider for Transition Assistance and Disengagement Services at the Service Provider’s then-current standard time and materials rates, or such other rates as may be mutually agreed upon in writing. If the termination is due to the Service Provider’s material breach, the Service Provider shall provide the Transition Assistance at no cost to the Client for the first ninety (90) days of the Transition Period. The Service Provider shall provide the Client with a detailed, good-faith estimate of the total costs of the Disengagement Plan prior to commencement.

6. Continued Performance Standards. During the Transition Period, the Service Provider shall remain obligated to meet all Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and performance metrics unless specifically waived in writing by the Client. The Service Provider shall not assign or reallocate key personnel involved in the provision of Services to other projects if such reallocation would materially jeopardize the stability of the Services or the effectiveness of the transition.

7. Survival of Provisions. The obligations set forth in this Section shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement and shall remain in full force and effect until the completion of the Transition Period or the final delivery of all Disengagement Services. Any breach of this Section by the Service Provider shall be deemed a material breach, and the Client shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief, without the necessity of posting a bond, to ensure the continuity of its business operations and the protection of its data.

The parties further agree that any dispute resolution proceedings shall be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file or participate in a class action or seek relief on a class-wide basis. Service of process, summons, notice, or other document by mail to such party’s principal place of business or the address set forth in the notice provisions of this Agreement shall be effective service of process for any suit, action, or other proceeding brought in any such court. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to preclude or otherwise limit any party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of its intellectual property rights or confidential information.

## Dispute Resolution, Mediation, and Arbitration

DISPUTE RESOLUTION, MEDIATION, AND ARBITRATION

1.1. Good Faith Negotiations. In the event of any controversy, claim, or dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof, or the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate (collectively, a "Dispute"), the parties hereto shall first attempt in good faith to resolve such Dispute through direct informal negotiations. Such negotiations shall commence upon the receipt of written notice by one party from the other party specifying the nature of the Dispute. The parties shall meet, either in person or via teleconference, within fifteen (15) business days of such notice to attempt to reach an amicable resolution.

1.2. Mediation. If the Dispute is not resolved through informal negotiations within thirty (30) calendar days following the initial notice of the Dispute, the parties agree to submit the Dispute to non-binding mediation. The mediation shall be administered by a mutually agreed-upon mediation service or, failing agreement, by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its Commercial Mediation Procedures. The mediation shall take place in the jurisdiction of the Company’s principal place of business, unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing. The costs of the mediator and the mediation venue shall be borne equally by the parties. Participation in mediation is a condition precedent to pursuing any other remedy available under this Agreement, except as provided in Section 1.7.

1.3. Binding Arbitration. If the Dispute remains unresolved for more than sixty (60) days after the commencement of mediation, or if the parties fail to agree upon a mediator within twenty (20) days of a request for mediation, the Dispute shall be settled by final and binding arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the AAA then in effect, except as modified by this Agreement. The arbitration shall be heard and determined by a single neutral arbitrator. If the parties cannot agree on the selection of an arbitrator within fifteen (15) days of the commencement of arbitration, the AAA shall appoint the arbitrator. The seat and venue of the arbitration shall be the city and state of the Company’s principal place of business. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award any remedy or relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could order or grant, including, without limitation, the issuance of an injunction or the imposition of specific performance. The arbitrator’s award shall be in writing, shall be final and binding upon the parties, and shall set forth the factual findings and legal conclusions upon which the award is based. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

1.4. Class Action Waiver. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO ASSERT ANY CLAIMS AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF A CLASS OR IN ANY MULTI-PARTY OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.

1.5. Waiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT THEY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT, OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER.

1.6. Allocation of Fees and Costs. In any arbitration or permitted judicial proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the non-prevailing party its reasonable attorneys' fees, expert witness fees, and all other costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Dispute, including the costs of any mediation or arbitration proceedings, in addition to any other relief to which the prevailing party may be entitled.

1.7. Equitable Relief and Exceptions. Notwithstanding the mandatory mediation and arbitration provisions set forth herein, either party may seek emergency injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction for the purpose of protecting its intellectual property rights, confidential information, or trade secrets, or to maintain the status quo pending the appointment of an arbitrator. The filing of such an action shall not be deemed a waiver of the obligation to arbitrate. Furthermore, any claim falling within the jurisdiction of a small claims court may be brought in such court on an individual basis.

1.8. Governing Law. This Section and all matters relating to the arbitration of Disputes shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) and, to the extent not inconsistent with the FAA, the laws of the jurisdiction of the Company’s principal place of business, without regard to its conflict of law principles.

1.9. Confidentiality of Proceedings. Except as may be required by law or to enforce an arbitration award, the parties, their representatives, and the arbitrator shall maintain the strict confidentiality of all aspects of the arbitration, including all evidence, testimony, and the arbitrator’s ruling.

1.10. Severability. If any provision of this Dispute Resolution section is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, such provision shall be severed, and the remainder of this section shall be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law, provided that if the Class Action Waiver is found to be unenforceable, the entirety of the arbitration agreement (excepting the waiver of jury trial) shall be null and void.

## Assignment and Change of Control

ASSIGNMENT AND CHANGE OF CONTROL.

(a) General Prohibition. Neither Party may assign, delegate, subcontract, mortgage, charge, or otherwise transfer any of its rights, interests, or obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily, involuntarily, or by operation of law, without the prior express written consent of the other Party. Any such consent may be granted or withheld at the sole and absolute discretion of the non-assigning Party, and any purported assignment or delegation in violation of this Section shall be null, void, and of no force or effect ab initio.

(b) Change of Control. For the purposes of this Agreement, a "Change of Control" shall be deemed an assignment requiring prior written consent. A "Change of Control" occurs if: (i) there is a sale, lease, exchange, or other transfer (in one transaction or a series of related transactions) of all or substantially all of the assets of a Party; (ii) any person or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of more than fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power of the voting stock of a Party; or (iii) a Party merges, consolidates, or reorganizes with or into another entity, or another entity merges into a Party, such that the shareholders of the Party immediately prior to such transaction do not own at least fifty percent (50%) of the surviving entity’s voting power immediately after the transaction.

(c) Permitted Assignments. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) and (b), either Party may, upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the other Party but without the requirement of consent, assign this Agreement in its entirety to (i) an Affiliate of the assigning Party, or (ii) a successor-in-interest pursuant to a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets or equity, provided that: (1) the assignee or successor is not a direct competitor of the non-assigning Party; (2) the assignee or successor expressly assumes in writing all obligations and liabilities of the assigning Party under this Agreement; and (3) the assignee or successor possesses the financial and operational capabilities necessary to fulfill the terms of this Agreement. For the purposes of this Section, "Affiliate" means any entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the subject Party, where "control" means the power to direct the management and policies of an entity.

(d) Obligations of Assignor. No assignment or delegation shall relieve the assigning Party of any of its obligations or liabilities accrued prior to the effective date of the assignment, nor shall it release the assigning Party from its duty to ensure the performance of this Agreement unless the non-assigning Party provides an express written release. The assigning Party shall remain jointly and severally liable with the assignee for all obligations under this Agreement unless otherwise agreed in writing.

(e) Binding Effect. Subject to the restrictions set forth herein, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective permitted successors and legal representatives. No third-party beneficiaries are intended or created by this Section except as expressly stated. Any breach of this Section shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement, entitling the non-breaching Party to immediate termination for cause and any other remedies available at law or in equity.

## Force Majeure and Excused Performance

SECTION [X]. FORCE MAJEURE AND EXCUSED PERFORMANCE

[X].1 Definition of Force Majeure Event. For the purposes of this Agreement, a "Force Majeure Event" shall mean any act, event, circumstance, or cause beyond the reasonable control of the Party claiming the benefit of this Section (the "Affected Party"), which by the exercise of reasonable foresight and diligence such Party is unable to prevent or overcome, and which materially hinders, delays, or prevents the performance of such Party’s obligations under this Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, Force Majeure Events shall include, but are not limited to: (a) acts of God, including but not limited to fire, flood, earthquake, windstorm, tornado, hurricane, or other natural disasters of overwhelming proportions; (b) war, hostilities (whether war be declared or not), invasion, act of foreign enemies, mobilization, requisition, or embargo; (c) rebellion, revolution, insurrection, or military or usurped power, or civil war; (d) acts of terrorism, sabotage, or piracy; (e) riot, commotion, strikes, go-slows, lockouts, or disorder, unless solely restricted to employees of the Affected Party or its subcontractors; (f) epidemics, pandemics, or outbreaks of communicable disease, and any resulting governmental quarantine or mandatory business closures; and (g) any law, order, proclamation, regulation, ordinance, demand, or requirement of any court, government, or any governmental agency or authority having jurisdiction over the Parties or the subject matter herein.

[X].2 Excuse from Performance. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no Party shall be deemed in default or breach of this Agreement, nor shall it be liable to the other Party for any cessation, interruption, or delay in the performance of its obligations (other than payment obligations) due to the occurrence of a Force Majeure Event, provided that the Affected Party complies with the notice and mitigation requirements set forth in Sections [X].3 and [X].4 below. The time for performance of the affected obligations shall be extended for a period equal to the duration of the Force Majeure Event.

[X].3 Notice Requirements. The Affected Party shall, within five (5) business days of the commencement of the Force Majeure Event, provide the other Party with written notice specifically identifying: (a) the nature and cause of the Force Majeure Event; (b) the date of its inception; (c) the anticipated duration of the delay or non-performance; (d) the specific obligations under this Agreement that are affected; and (e) the measures being taken or proposed to be taken to mitigate the effects of such event. The Affected Party shall further provide periodic status updates no less than weekly during the pendency of the Force Majeure Event and shall provide immediate written notice upon the cessation of the event. Failure to provide notice within the timeframe specified shall preclude the Affected Party from claiming the protections of this Section for the period prior to the delivery of such notice.

[X].4 Mitigation and Resumption of Performance. The Affected Party shall use all commercially reasonable efforts and exercise due diligence to minimize the impact of the Force Majeure Event, to find alternative means of performing its obligations, and to resume full performance as soon as practicable. If, due to a Force Majeure Event, the Affected Party is unable to perform some but not all of its obligations, it shall continue to perform those obligations not affected by the Force Majeure Event.

[X].5 Financial Obligations. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, a Force Majeure Event shall not excuse, delay, or otherwise affect any Party’s obligation to make payments of money due and payable under this Agreement for services rendered or goods delivered prior to or during the Force Majeure Event. Economic hardship, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, changes in market conditions, or the insufficiency of funds shall not constitute a Force Majeure Event.

[X].6 Right of Termination. In the event that a Force Majeure Event continues for a cumulative or consecutive period of more than sixty (60) days, and such event materially prevents the Affected Party from fulfilling its primary obligations under this Agreement, the Party not affected by the Force Majeure Event may terminate this Agreement immediately upon written notice to the Affected Party. In the event of such termination, neither Party shall have any further liability to the other, except for obligations that accrued prior to the onset of the Force Majeure Event or those obligations which by their nature are intended to survive the termination of this Agreement.

## Notices and Communications

NOTICES AND COMMUNICATIONS. 
All notices, requests, demands, consents, claims, waivers, authorizations, and other communications required or permitted under this Agreement (each, a “Notice”) shall be in writing and shall be addressed to the respective parties at the addresses set forth on the signature page of this Agreement, or to such other address, facsimile number, or electronic mail address as a party may designate from time to time by Notice duly given in accordance with the provisions of this Section. All Notices shall be delivered via one of the following methods: (i) personal delivery by hand; (ii) a nationally recognized overnight courier service with all fees and costs prepaid and tracking requested; (iii) registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid; or (iv) electronic mail or facsimile transmission, provided that the sender does not receive an automated notification that the delivery failed and, if the Notice concerns a material breach, default, or termination of this Agreement, a hard copy of such Notice is also dispatched via one of the methods described in clauses (i) through (iii) hereof within one (1) business day of such electronic transmission. A Notice shall be deemed to have been sufficiently given and received for all purposes: (a) if delivered by hand, on the date of actual delivery as evidenced by written receipt; (b) if sent by overnight courier, on the first business day following the date of deposit with such courier; (c) if sent by registered or certified mail, on the third (3rd) business day following the date of mailing; or (d) if sent by electronic mail or facsimile, on the date of transmission if such transmission is completed during the recipient's normal business hours (9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. local time at the place of receipt) on a business day, or on the next business day if transmission is completed after such hours or on a day that is not a business day. For the purposes of this Section, a "business day" shall mean any day other than a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday on which commercial banks in the jurisdiction of the recipient are authorized or required by law to remain closed. Any party may change its contact information for the purposes of this Section by providing Notice of such change to the other party in the manner set forth herein, which change shall be effective ten (10) days after deemed receipt. The parties hereby consent to the use of electronic signatures for the execution of this Agreement and any ancillary documents or subsequent Notices, and expressly agree that such electronic signatures shall be treated as original signatures for all legal purposes under the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA), the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-SIGN), and any other applicable jurisdiction-specific statutes governing electronic commerce. Proof of sending shall not constitute proof of receipt; the burden of proving that a Notice was duly given shall rest upon the party claiming that such Notice was provided. Failure to comply with the specific notice requirements set forth in this Section shall render any purported Notice null, void, and of no legal effect, unless the receiving party has waived such requirements in a signed writing.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Statement of Work may specifically stipulate that its terms supersede a specific provision of the main body of this Agreement for the purposes of that specific Statement of Work only, provided that such Statement of Work explicitly references the section of the main body being superseded and expresses the clear intent of both parties to deviate from the master terms.

1.3 Amendments.

The rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law or in equity. Any waiver of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same or any other provision.
